Many malicious programs create copies of themselves or other malicious programs using file names used by Windows system files. This is typically done to override or replace system files, avoid detection, or discourage users from deleting the malicious files.
The Hosts file matches domain names with IP addresses. Many malicious programs modify the Hosts file so that the Web browser is redirected to infected, non-existent, or fake Web sites.
New Internet Explorer Plugin
Many viruses and spyware programs change Internet Explorer settings, including the home page, trusted Web sites, proxy server settings, and menu extensions.
Internet Explorer Setting Modification
Many malicious programs configure Windows so that all applications automatically load a program library (DLL). This allows the malicious routines in the DLL to run every time an application starts.
Windows services are processes that have special functions and typically run continuously in the background with full administrative access. Malicious programs sometimes install themselves as services to stay hidden.
Certain Windows system files determine system behavior, including startup programs and screensaver settings. Many malicious programs modify system files to launch automatically at startup and control system behavior.
The Windows Firewall policy determines the applications that have access to the network, the ports that are open for communication, and the IP addresses that can communicate with the computer. Many malicious programs modify the policy to allow themselves to access to the network and the Internet.
Many malicious programs perform various actions on built-in Windows processes. These actions can include terminating or modifying running processes.
Malicious applications usually add or modify autostart entries in the Windows registry to automatically launch every time the computer starts.

Adds support for four new Internet Security reports.
Enhancement 3: Modifications and Additions to URL Filtering Categories
Modified and added a number of URL filtering categories.
Solution 1: This hotfix resolves this issue by disabling the multicast_snooping function in Cloud Edge.
When this happens, Cloud Edge temporarily blocks mail and HTTPS traffic through the VLAN.
Solution 1: This hotfix resolves this issue by not holding HTTP 3xx responses during a VSAPI scan.
Issue 3:    The SMTP server cannot send emails with the "BDAT" command in Cloud Edge.
Solution 3: This hotfix resolves this issue by correcting the handling server responses with the "BDAT" command.
Solution 2: This hotfix resolves this issue by recording the email bandwidth log with no delay.

The  appliance supports administrative access from IPv4 clients using the on-premises console, ping, SSH, and SNMP.
You can optionally enable Cloud Scan for cloud-based malware scanning of IPv4 traffic.
Enabling cloud scan redirects IPv4 traffic to the Web Cloud Scan server for malware analysis.
does not scan IPv6 email traffic using either Cloud Message Scan or local scan.
IPv6 email traffic passes through the appliance without scanning.
Approved senders are excluded from spam and content filters and from Virtual Analyzer/Predictive Machine Learning analysis.
There are certain differences between CMS and local scan.
Keep the following in mind when adding URLs or FQDN/IP addresses to a list:
Additionally, FQDNs and URL entries can resolve to either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.
