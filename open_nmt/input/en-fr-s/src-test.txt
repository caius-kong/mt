To explain component duplication for the server, refer to the following scenario:
The difference between versions 171 and 175 is 2.
In other words, the server does not have versions 173 and 175.
This incremental pattern accounts for the difference between versions 171 and 175.
On the server, TMEndpointEdt merges version 171 with incremental pattern 171.175 to generate version 175.
The server generates incremental patterns based on the other full patterns available on the server.
The server compares its current incremental patterns with the incremental patterns available on the ActiveUpdate server.
The server downloads the incremental patterns it does not have.
The TMEndpointEdt server downloads an additional 7 incremental patterns:
The server now has all the incremental patterns available on the ActiveUpdate server.

SSL provides an extra layer of protection against hackers.
SSL tunneling prevents hackers from sniffing packets traversing the network.
The SSL version used depends on the version that the web server supports.
When selecting SSL, Setup automatically creates an SSL certificate, which is a requirement for SSL connections.
The certificate contains server information, public key, and private key.
The SSL certificate should have a validity period between 1 and 20 years.
The administrator can still use the certificate after it expires.
However, a warning message appears every time SSL connection is invoked using the same certificate.
The administrator sends information from the web console to the web server through SSL connection.
The web server responds to the web console with the required certificate.
The browser performs key exchange using RSA encryption.
The web console sends data to the web server using RC4 encryption.
Although RSA encryption is more secure, it slows down the communication flow.

If these are not your preferred actions, you can change them to Quarantine, Delete, or Rename.
Future pattern files could update the default actions.
Data related to the following features is stored and can be viewed in logs:
Specify the date range and types of log results to display.
The following table provides a comparison between the two scan methods.
All components available on the update source, except the Virus Pattern
The scan engine also detects controlled viruses that are developed and used for research.
The precise location within a file where the virus resides
The Smart Scan Pattern contains majority of the pattern definitions.
The Scan Server verifies the risk using the Smart Scan Pattern.
The Virus Scan Driver monitors user operations on files.
Operations include opening or closing a file, and executing an application.
There are two versions for this driver. These are TmXPFlt.sys and TmPreFlt.sys.
This component does not display on the console.
The Damage Cleanup Engine scans for and removes Trojans and Trojan processes.
The Spyware/Grayware Scan Engine scans for and performs the appropriate scan action on spyware/grayware.
This pattern contains the rules for detecting suspicious threat behavior.
This user mode service has the following functions:
The Behavior Monitoring Core Service checks system events against the policies in this pattern.
This engine also restores the affected files after it receives a file recovery request.
The Damage Recovery Pattern contains policies that are used for monitoring suspicious threat behavior.
The Program Inspection Monitoring Pattern monitors and stores inspection points that are used for Behavior Monitoring.
A file that includes the database for all vulnerabilities.
The Vulnerability Assessment Pattern provides instructions for the scan engine to scan for known vulnerabilities.
This pattern analyzes script in web pages and identifies malicious script.
In addition, programs with a valid digital signature are always allowed to start.
Repeat this step until all the programs have been added.

In the United States, Trend Micro representatives are available by phone or email:
This opens a window with the following tabs containing the settings:
Event Monitoring provides a more generic approach to protecting against unauthorized software and malware attacks.
It monitors system areas for certain events, allowing administrators to regulate programs that trigger such events.
The following table provides a list of monitored system events.
The Hosts file matches domain names with IP addresses.
Programs exhibiting suspicious behavior should be used with caution.
Spyware/grayware programs often install unwanted Internet Explorer plugins, including toolbars and Browser Helper Objects.
Modifications in Windows Security Policy can allow unwanted applications to run and change system settings.
This allows the malicious routines in the DLL to run every time an application starts.
Many malicious programs modify Windows shell settings to associate themselves to certain file types.
Malicious programs sometimes install themselves as services to stay hidden.
Certain Windows system files determine system behavior, including startup programs and screen saver settings.
Many malicious programs modify system files to launch automatically at startup and control system behavior.
These actions can include terminating or modifying running processes.
When Event Monitoring detects a monitored system event, it performs the action configured for the event.
The following table lists possible actions that administrators can take on monitored system events.
This is the default action for all monitored system events.
Gather system information and submit suspicious file content to Trend Micro:
This appendix describes how to get help, find additional information, and contact Trend Micro.
IntelliScan is a method of identifying files to scan.
The scan time is therefore significantly shorter than when you scan all files.
This overwrites the header information in the first TCP fragment and may pass through a firewall.
Similar to an overlapping fragment attack, this Denial of Service attack deals with IP fragments.
Used to enable all features that may otherwise be restricted by the administrator.
Malware Behavior Blocking also detects threats and takes action on them.
Deleted files and other objects associated with the program.
It observes system events over a period of time.
Use this feature to ensure a higher level of protection against new, unknown, and emerging threats.
Known threats: Blocks behaviors associated with known malware threats
Malware Behavior Blocking analyzes program behavior to proactively protect against both known and unknown threats.
Malware Behavior Blocking observes system events and blocks programs that exhibit malicious activity.
After detecting malicious activity, Malware Behavior Blocking performs one of the following actions:
You can open the console from the Start menu.
If it is already running, the console opens.
You can also open the console from the Windows Task Bar.
Cleans the infected file before allowing full access to the file.
This action can be performed on all types of security threats except probable virus/malware.
Performs no action on detected threats but records the detection in the logs.
Mail Scan cannot detect security risks in IMAP messages.
IntelliTrap detects malicious code, such as bots, in compressed files.
Enable CVE exploit scanning for files downloaded through web and email channels
A compressed file has one layer for each time it has been compressed.
Scanning through multiple layers, however, requires more time and resources.
The Spyware/Grayware Approved List determines which spyware or grayware applications users can use.
Scan the boot sector of the USB storage device after plugging in
Scan all files on the USB storage device after plugging in
Automatically scans all files on a USB storage device every time the user plugs it in.
All subdirectories in the directory path you specify will also be excluded.
