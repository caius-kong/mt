The Privacy Scanner checks apps to determine if they might secretly attempt to steal private information. It connects to Trend Micro through the Internet to get the very latest information about new apps identified as privacy risks.

After a privacy scan, you can see what personal information an app may try to collect from your mobile device. Keep in mind that apps may secretly gather information for a legitimate purpose.
For example, a backup app might make copies of your photos on the Internet, and that behavior could trigger an alert. However, most risky apps try to gather information that they should not access. A weather app has no good reason to make copies of your photos, for instance.
Trend Micro &trade; Mobile Security can help you see if an app has legitimately collected information, and then you can decide if you want to keep the app. Mobile Security assigns a severity rating to each app:
<b>High risk </b> apps can send out your personal and private information such as messages, photos, contacts, your phone number, audio recordings and so on.
<b>Low risk </b> apps can  send out basic device information and user created content, such as unique device identifiers, information downloaded from the Internet and keystrokes. Apps that record audio clips, open camera, show advertisements in notifications, or add icons to the home screen are also Low risk apps.

Web Threat Protection
Activate this feature for protection against online fraud, malicious software embedded in websites, and other security threats found on the Internet.
This setting will prevent you from opening websites that show any signs of transmitting malicious software. To be on the safe side, even suspicious sites that might not actually cause problems are blocked. You might want to choose this level of protection when children use the web.
Filter websites based on your selections below:
Block websites on the list below
This is null
Sites that allow or encourage visitors to join or learn about groups seeking to influence or change political or cultural institutions or organizations. Also includes sites that host, promote, or provide links to journals, periodicals, or other publications with unusual viewpoints or interpretations of current events and society.
Trend Micro recommends this setting for regular daily use. It provides protection against malicious software, online fraud, and other threats, without aggressively blocking minor security risks.
