Data Loss Prevention evaluates condition statements from left to right.
Use logical operators carefully when configuring condition statements.
Incorrect usage leads to an erroneous condition statement that will likely produce unexpected results.
[Data Identifier1] And [Data Identifier 2] Except [Data Identifier 3]
A file must satisfy [Data Identifier 1] and [Data Identifier 2] but not [Data Identifier 3].
A file must satisfy [Data Identifier 1] or [Data Identifier 2].
A file must be [an Adobe PDF document] or [a Microsoft Word document].
A file must not satisfy [Data Identifier 1].
A file must not be [a multimedia file].
In most cases, however, the first data identifier does not have an operator.
In the United States, Trend Micro representatives are available by phone or email:
An expression must include the characters you have specified.
In addition, the number of characters in the expression must be within the minimum and maximum limits.
Suffix refers to the last segment of an expression.
A suffix must include the characters you have specified and contain a certain number of characters.
An expression must have two segments separated by a character.
The character must be 1 byte in length.
In addition, the number of characters left of the separator must be within the minimum and maximum limits.
The number of characters right of the separator must not exceed the maximum limit.
Create your own templates if you have configured data identifiers.
A template combines data identifiers and logical operators (And, Or, Except) to form condition statements.
For more information and examples on how condition statements and logical operators work, see .
Create customized expressions if none of the predefined expressions meet the company's requirements.
Become comfortable with expression syntax before creating expressions.
Refer to the predefined expressions for guidance on how to define valid expressions.
For example, when creating an expression that includes a date, refer to the expressions prefixed with "Date".
Note that Data Loss Prevention follows the expression formats defined in Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE).
For more information on PCRE, visit the following website:
Modify the expressions if they are causing false alarms or fine tune them to improve detections.
Administrators can choose from several criteria when creating expressions.
An expression must satisfy the chosen criteria before Data Loss Prevention subjects it to a DLP policy.
For details about the different criteria options, see .
A file must contain at least one keyword in the keyword list.
A file must contain all the keywords in the keyword list.
In addition, each keyword pair must be within <x> characters of each other.
The following data does not match the criteria: DISK*******************WEB****USB(23 characters between "D" and "W")
This may reduce the likelihood of detecting sensitive data, especially in large files.
As the number increases, the area covered also increases but scanning time might be slower.
A file must contain one or more keywords in the keyword list.
If only one keyword was detected, its score must be higher than the threshold.
If there are several keywords, their combined score must be higher than the threshold.
Assign each keyword a score of 1 to 10.
Words or phrases that, by themselves, do not carry much weight can have lower scores.
Consider the scores that you assigned to the keywords when configuring the threshold.
This means that the detection of these three keywords is enough to treat the file as sensitive.
Create customized keyword lists if none of the predefined keyword lists meet your requirements.
There are several criteria that you can choose from when configuring a keyword list.
A keyword list must satisfy your chosen criteria before Data Loss Prevention subjects it to a policy.
Choose one of the following criteria for each keyword list:
For details regarding the criteria rules, see .
Digital assets are files and data that an organization must protect against unauthorized transmission.
Administrators can define digital assets using the following data identifiers:
File attributes: File properties such as file type and file size.
Keyword lists: A list of special words or phrases.
Administrators cannot delete a data identifier that a DLP template is using.
Delete the template before deleting the data identifier.
Use this option if you have a properly-formatted .dat file containing the expressions.
Click Import and then locate the .dat file containing the expressions.
A message appears, informing you if the import was successful.
If an expression to be imported already exists, it will be skipped.
The name must not exceed expression_name_length bytes in length and cannot contain the following characters:
Type a description that does not exceed 256 bytes in length.
Type the expression and specify whether it is case-sensitive.
For example, if you are creating an expression for ID numbers, type a sample ID number.
This data is used for reference purposes only and will not appear elsewhere in the product.
Choose one of the following criteria and configure additional settings for the chosen criteria (see ):
Click Save if you are satisfied with the result.
Save the settings only if the testing was successful.
An expression that cannot detect any data wastes system resources and may impact performance.
An expression is data that has a certain structure.
Type a name for the file attribute list.
Data Loss Prevention checks files with the specified extension but does not check their true file types.
Each extension must start with an asterisk (*), followed by a period (.), and then the extension.
The asterisk is a wildcard, which represents a file’s actual name.
- *.*m matches the following files: ABC.dem, ABC.prm, ABC.sdcm
- *.m*r matches the following files: ABC.mgdr, ABC.mtp2r, ABC.mdmr
- *.fm? matches the following files: ABC.fme, ABC.fml, ABC.fmp
There is no need to add a space after a semicolon.
Type the minimum and maximum file sizes in bytes.
Both file sizes must be whole numbers larger than zero.
Use this option if you have a properly-formatted filetype file containing the file attribute lists.
Click Import and then locate the filetype file containing the file attribute lists.
If a file attribute list to be imported already exists, it will be skipped.
Choose one of the following criteria and configure additional settings for the chosen criteria:
Type a keyword that is 3 to 40 bytes in length and specify whether it is case-sensitive.
To add keywords by using the "import" option:
Use this option if you have a properly-formatted .csv file containing the keywords.
Click Import and then locate the .csv file containing the keywords.
If a keyword to be imported already exists in the list, it will be skipped.
To delete keywords, select the keywords and click Delete.
Use the "export" feature to back up the keywords or to import them to another server.
All keywords in the keyword list will be exported.
It is not possible to export individual keywords.
Save the resulting .csv file to your preferred location.
Use this option if you have a properly-formatted filetype file containing the keyword lists.
Click Import and then locate the filetype file containing the keyword lists.
If a keyword list to be imported already exists, it will be skipped.
Select data identifiers and then click the "add" icon.
Select multiple entries by pressing and holding the CTRL key and then selecting the data identifiers.
Use the search feature if you have a specific definition in mind.

Below Preview, check the condition statement and make changes if this is not your intended statement.
Use this option if you have a properly-formatted .dat file containing the templates.
Click Import and then locate the filetype file containing the templates.
If a template to be imported already exists, it will be skipped.
You can add related keywords to a keyword list to identify specific types of data.
For example, "prognosis", "blood type", "vaccination", and "physician" are keywords that may appear in a medical certificate.
Commonly used words can be combined to form meaningful keywords.
You can use predefined and customized keyword lists.
Data Loss Prevention comes with a set of predefined expressions.
Data Loss Prevention verifies these expressions using pattern matching and mathematical equations.
For a complete list of predefined expressions, see the Data Protection Lists document at http://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/enterprise/data-protection-reference-documents.aspx.

If your proxy server requires authentication, specify a valid user name and password.
Security Agents update from the Security Server, Update Agents, or the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server.
Messaging Security Agents update only from the Security Server.
For details on the update process, see .
Similarly, a pure IPv4 agent cannot obtain updates directly from a pure IPv6 Security Server/Update Agent.
For details on the components that agents update, see .
In addition to the components, agents also receive updated configuration files when updating from the Security Server.
Each time you modify agent settings through the web console, the configuration files change.
Clients include desktops, servers, and Microsoft Exchange servers.
Protects desktops and servers from security threats and intrusions
Protects Microsoft Exchange servers from email-borne security threats
An agent reports to the Security Server from which it was installed.
Agents report events such as threat detection, startup, shutdown, start of a scan, and completion of an update.
product_short_name provides two ways to combat spam—Email Reputation and Content Scanning.
The Messaging Security Agent uses the following components to filter email messages for spam and phishing incidents:
Trend Micro updates both the engine and pattern file frequently and makes them available for download.
The Security Server can download these components through a manual or scheduled update.
The anti-spam engine uses spam signatures and heuristic rules to filter email messages.
The Messaging Security Agent compares the spam score to the user-defined spam detection level.
When the spam score exceeds the detection level, the agent takes action against the spam.
An Approved Senders list is a list of trusted email addresses.
A Blocked Senders list is a list of suspect email addresses.
The agent always categorizes email messages from blocked senders as spam and takes the appropriate action.
There are two Approved Senders lists: one for the Microsoft Exchange Administrator and one for the end-users.
The end-user manages the Spam Folder that is created for them during installation.
The end-users’ lists only affect the messages bound for the server-side mailbox store for each individual end-user.
The Messaging Security Agent supports wildcard matching for Approved and Blocked Senders lists.
It uses the asterisk (*) as the wildcard character.
The Messaging Security Agent does not support the wildcard match on the user name part.
However, if you type a pattern such as “*@trend.com”, the agent still treats it as “@trend.com”.
You can only use a wildcard if it is:
Next to only one period and the first or last character of a string
To the left of an @ sign and the first character in the string
Any missing section at the beginning or end of the string serves the same function as a wildcard
Check with QA to see if this info is correct.
Automatic URL approval and blocking helps you control access to websites and create a safer Internet environment.
Identify approved or blocked URLs in the Global Settings.
It is also possible to create customized URL approval and blocking lists for specific groups.
Attachment blocking prevents attachments in email messages from being delivered to the Microsoft Exchange Information Store.
The extension of an attachment identifies the file type, for example .txt, .exe, or .dll.
Many virus/malware are closely associated with certain types of files.
Similarly, specific attacks are often associated with a specific file name.
Using blocking is an effective way to control virus outbreaks.
Later, when you have more time, you can examine the quarantine folder and take action against infected files.
product_name documentation is intended for the following users:
Security Administrators: Responsible for product_name management, including Security Server and agent installation and management.
End users: Users who have the Security Agent installed on their computers.
Security Agents and Messaging Security Agents (Advanced only) automatically perform the following updates:
Immediately after installation, the agents update from the Security Server.
Each time the Security Server completes an update, it automatically pushes the updates to agents.
Each time an Update Agent completes an update, it automatically pushes the updates to the respective Security Agents.
Every 8 hours on In Office Security Agents
Every 2 hours on Out of Office Security Agents
By default, Messaging Security Agents run a scheduled update every 24 hours at 12:00 AM.
The Security Agent features available on a client depend on the client's operating system.
Be aware of unsupported features when installing an agent to a particular operating system.
Microsoft Outlook 2007 (32-bit), 2010 (32- and 64-bit), 2013 (32- and 64-bit)
Identify the device in the device wipe table and click Cancel Wipe.
Users can change the language from the agent interface.
The following image shows the Security Agent Console with everything up-to-date and working properly:
The following table lists the icons and their meanings on the Security Agent Console Main User Interface:
Security Agent has discovered threats that it cannot fix immediately.
Restart the computer to finish fixing these threats.
Security Agent has not had access to the Scan Server for over 15 minutes.
Grant agent privileges to allow users to modify Security Agent settings on the client.
To enforce a regulated security policy throughout your organization, Trend Micro recommends granting limited privileges to users.
This ensures users do not modify scan settings or unload the Security Agent.
This section explains compatibility issues that may arise with certain third-party applications.
Security Applications in Windows SBS and EBS 2008
product_short_name is compatible with both Windows Small Business Server (SBS) 2008 and Windows Essential Business Server (EBS) 2008.

Content filtering: Quarantines email messages containing restricted content.
By default, all directories have the same paths (<Messaging Security Agent installation folder>\storage\quarantine).
You can change the paths for each or all of the directories.
Set the path for the following quarantine directories:
Configure who receives notifications when an event occurs.
When you installed the Security Server, you are given the option to enable smart scan.
You can switch agents between these scan methods according to your current requirements.
Be sure that the Disable Smart Scan Service option has been disabled.
The following table lists some considerations when switching scan methods:
Ensure that Security Agents can connect to the Security Server.
Only online agents will be notified to switch to a different scan method.
Switching a relatively small number of Security Agents at a time allows efficient use of Security Server resources.
The Security Server can perform other critical tasks while agents change their scan methods.
Trend Micro recommends that you do not schedule a scan at the same time as a scheduled update.
This may cause the Scheduled Scan to stop prematurely.
Configure the scan frequency (daily, weekly, or monthly) and start time.
Each group or Messaging Security Agent can have its own schedule.
(Optional) Click the Settings tab to customize Scheduled Scan settings.
To customize scan settings for the Security Agent, click a desktop or server group.
Scan compressed files up to layer 2: Scans compressed files that are 2 compression layers deep.
Do not scan the directories where Trend Micro products are installed
To customize scan settings for the Messaging Security Agent, expand an agent and click the following:
Antivirus: Click to have the agent scan for viruses and other malware.
Content Filtering: Click to have the agent scan email for prohibited content.
Attachment Blocking: Click to have the agent scan email for attachment rule violations.
The agent performs a scan every Sunday, starting at 5:00 AM.
Customize this schedule to run during an off-peak time for your clients.
It includes the message bodies of email messages in the scan.
When the agent detects a file with a virus or other malware, it cleans the file.
When it cannot clean the file, it replaces with text/file instead.
When the agent detects a file with a Packer, it replaces it with text/file.
The agent does not clean infected compressed files.
Select the groups or Messaging Security Agents that will apply the Scheduled Scan settings.
To disable Scheduled Scan, clear the check box for the group or Messaging Security Agent.
Configure the Security Server to regularly check its update source and automatically download any available updates.
Using scheduled update is an easy and effective way of ensuring that protection against threats is always current.
The scan engine and other components are also updated regularly.
Avoid scheduling a scan and an update to run at the same time.
This may cause the Scheduled Scan to stop unexpectedly.
Click the Schedule tab and then specify the update schedule.
The Security Server updates at any given time during this time period.
If none of your agents use smart scan, disregard this item.
product_short_name uses the Microsoft Exchange default policy as the default policy.
The default policy appears in the Security Policy list.
product_short_name does not maintain non-default policies added using the Microsoft Exchange management console or the Exchange Cmdlet.
Trend Micro recommends administrators manage security policies from product_short_name management console or Microsoft Exchange.
Select the security criteria to apply to the device:
Minimum password length: For guidelines on mobile device passwords, see .
Minimum number of required character sets: For guidelines on mobile device passwords, see .

The default value is 14 days and the maximum time limit is 30 days.
To disable the End User Quarantine tool for select users:
The end user’s email address is added to the list of addresses that have EUQ disabled.
Click the System tab and update the following as required:
product_short_name represents the client connection status in the Security Groups Tree using icons.
However, certain conditions may prevent the Security Groups Tree from displaying the correct agent connection status.
This agent will still appear as online in the Security Groups Tree.
You can verify agent-server connection manually or schedule the verification from the web console.
Connection Verification does not allow the selection of specific groups or agents.
It verifies the connection of all agents registered with the Security Server.
Enable scheduled verification: Enables scheduled verification of agent-server connection.
Start time: The time the verification should start.
By default, Security Agents send quarantined infected files to the following directory in the Security Server:
Quarantine folder capacity: The size of the quarantine folder in MB.
Delete All Quarantined Files: Deletes all files in the Quarantine folder.
If the folder is full and a new file is uploaded, the new file will not be stored.
If needed, change the directory by typing an absolute path.
Only future agents will be installed to this directory; existing agents maintain their current directory.
Use one of the following variables to set the installation path:
$BOOTDISK: The drive letter of the boot disk
High: blocks all incoming and outgoing traffic except any traffic allowed in the exception list.
Low: allows all incoming and outgoing traffic except any traffic blocked in the exception list.
