Although more secure, accessing websites using HTTPS still has risks. Compromised sites, even those with valid certificates, can host malware and steal personal information. Certificates are easy to obtain, making it easy to set up malicious web servers that use HTTPS.
OfficeScan only supports scanning the 7-Zip compression type with VSAPI Scan Engine 9.7 installed on the client computer. Clients that do not have the updated scan engine installed skip this file type.
When enabled, Web Reputation only checks URLs with no port information or those that point to ports 80, 81, or 8080. When disabled, this option scans all HTTP URLs regardless of their port information.
IntelliScan optimizes performance by examining file headers using true file type recognition, and scanning only file types known to potentially harbor malicious code.True file type recognition helps identify malicious code that can be disguised by a harmless extension name.
If large-file scanning is enabled, the file size specified for deferred scanning must be smaller (typically, 50% or more) than the file size specified for large-file scanning.

About Anti-DoS
A denial-of-service (DoS) or a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to users, and is intended to temporarily or indefinitely interrupt or suspend services to a host connected to the Internet.
TCP SYN flood
DoS attack
A Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Synchronous Transmission (SYN) flood occurs when a malicious host sends a flood of TCP/SYN packets - often with a forged sender address.
Each of these packets is handled like a connection request, causing the server to spawn half-open connections by sending back a TCP/SYN-ACK packet (Acknowledge), and waiting for a packet in response from the sender address (response to the ACK Packet).
UDP flood
A User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flood overloads the target server by repeatedly sending an overwhelming number of UDP packets.
ICMP/Ping flood
An Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) flood sends its victims an overwhelming number of ping packets, usually by using the "ping" command.
Deep Edge, Cloud Edge (Skynet for MSP)
You can deploy appliances to customer locations and register the appliance as a gateway with Cloud Console for remote management through the cloud.
Configure User Virtual Private Network (VPN) settings with Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), Secure Sockets Layer VPN (SSL VPN), or Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) VPN

Configure static routes and NAT
About HTTPS Inspection
HTTPS inspection
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are cryptographic protocols widely adopted and deployed in network communication today.
Because encrypted HTTPS connections can carry the same risks as unencrypted HTTP connections, scans all traffic for potential risks and threats.
To scan HTTPS traffic, identifies the SSL connection at the first packet of the SSL handshake, acquires the client IP address information from the session, if available, and then gets the server host name from the handshake record.
Traffic will not be decrypted if this information matches any allowed URL categories, websites, or IP addresses in the exception list.
From the Analysis & Reports tab, you can view interactive charts and graphs about log statistics uploaded from registered gateways and aggregated by Cloud Console.
Using traditional routing protocols, the higher bandwidth link would get most if not all of the traffic sent across it based on the metric savings obtained by the bandwidth and/or delay (using EIGRP or OSPF) characteristics of the link.
How VLANs Work
A Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) is a group of endpoints, servers, and other network devices that communicate as if they are on the same LAN segment, regardless of their location.
Endpoints and servers can belong to the same VLAN even though they are geographically scattered and connected to numerous network segments.
A VLAN segregates devices logically, not physically.
Devices in VLAN 1 can connect with other devices in VLAN 1, but cannot connect with devices in other VLANs.
A VLAN segregates devices by adding 802.1Q VLAN tags to all packets sent and received by the devices in the VLAN.

The primary purpose of this is to redirect incoming packets with a destination of a public address/port to a private IP address/port inside the network.
NAT type
Select ANY or any L3 interface from the drop-down list to act as the interface for network traffic that originates from outside of the network’s routers and proceeds toward a destination inside of the network.
Destination IP translation
When not using the ingress interface IP address, users must explicitly specify an interface with the next option, Use Virtual IP address.
Use a Virtual IP address—When users specify an external IP address range, the translated IP address range is automatically generated according to the beginning IP address.
Port Forward—Check the Port Forward check box for static one-to-one NAT mapping with port forwarding: an external IP address is always translated to the same mapped IP address, and an external port number is always translated to the same mapped port number.
Advanced options for DNAT
Source IP address range: Specified by administrator.

automatically creates a default source NAT rule.
Select Source for NAT type.
Configure the NAT settings, then click Save.
Select ANY or any L3 interface (for example, eth0) from the drop-down box list to act as an interface for egress traffic, which is traffic that originates from inside the network.
Source IP translation / Translate to
If you select Single IP address, IP address range, or Subnet, you must explicitly specify an L3 interface for the Egress interface option.
Advanced options for SNAT
Protocol—Any, TCP, UDP, or ICMP.
Source IP address range—Specified by the network.

You should be aware of a performance issue for a certain IPsec connection configuration and the best practice recommendation for eliminating the performance issue.
Performance issues can occur when a customer environment contains more than one Cloud Edge appliance with multiple IPsec VPN connections.
To avoid any unnecessary scans, the best practice is to scan traffic only once by the Cloud Edge appliance that is closest to the incoming traffic and configure other appliances in the route from source to destination to bypass the scan.

However, you must configure an IP address on the bridge interface (br0) to register the appliance with Cloud Console.
Configure bridge mode when operates on a private network behind an existing firewall or router so that can perform all scanning functions transparently.
C&C Information Pattern
If the user identification agent is unable to associate a user with an IP address, a captive portal can take over and authenticate the user with a web form.
To receive the web form, users must be using a web browser and be in the process of connecting.
If the above-mentioned captive portal rules do not apply because the traffic is not HTTP or there is no rule match, then the appliance applies its IP address-based security policies.
If successfully authenticated, the appliance adds the IP address-to-user mapping to local cache for the time-to-live (TTL) life cycle.

Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
Cloud Edge Overview
brings together the benefits of a next-generation on-premises firewall and the convenience of security as a service for MSPs (Managed Service Providers).
URL filtering, bandwidth control, intrusion protection, anti-malware scanning, email security, and web reputation security provide additional protection from network breaches and business disruptions.
Remote Manager works with Cloud Edge by providing a single point of entry to access graphical reports and summarized dashboard data for supported appliances and Trend Micro products.
The following illustration shows how works.
Cloud Edge Components
Remote Manager
Remote Manager is a single pane of glass management console for Trend Micro channel partners and MSPs, providing a real-time security dashboard and reporting across all customers as well as license management.
Cloud Message Scan (CMS) and Local Scan
If CMS is not available (for example, if there are network issues between the on-premises appliance and the CMS service), continues to provide email security by switching to local email security scanning on the appliance.
Cloud Message Scan (CMS)
MyNumber: Supports MyNumber filtering in message body
Protocol support: SMTP/SMTPS, POP3/POP3S, and IMAP/IMAPS
Uses STARTTLS commands
Protocol support: SMTP and POP3
IntelliTrap Pattern and Exceptions
IntelliTrap detection uses a scan option in the Trend Micro’s virus scanning engine with IntelliTrap pattern (for potentially malicious files) and IntelliTrap Exception pattern (as an allowed list).
IntelliTrap provides a heuristic evaluation of compressed files to help reduce the risk that a bot or any other malicious compressed file might cause to a network.

DNS interface configuration
Configure DHCP to use the appliance, interface, or specified DNS IP addresses and then configure the IP address pool and default gateway address that the DHCP server provides.
One DHCP pool supports one physical pool.
DNS Best Practice Suggestions
DNS servers
In general, before builds up its local DNS cache, two DNS requests will be made for each URL accessed.
Make sure your DNS server is installed on a server with enough resources and performance to handle the extra DNS volume.
To reduce latency, each DNS server should have a fast network card and be installed on a fast network switch.
In general, ISP DNS servers have higher latency and do not support large numbers of DNS queries from a single IP address.
Many ISP DNS servers have throttling mechanisms that limit the number of DNS requests per second and can affect 's Web Reputation Services (WRS) performance.
To improve network response time and performance, try to place the DNS server as close to the unit(s) as possible to eliminate unnecessary network hops between the devices.
Managing DNS
Since environments that utilize DHCP or PPPoE to access the Internet might dynanically acquire the DNS configuration from the ISP, you might not be required to configure DNS settings in these environments.
The Deployment Guide is a PDF document that introduces and explains how to use Remote Manager, how to register gateways and synchronize accounts in Cloud Console, and how to deploy the appliance at consumer office locations.
If a patch has not been applied (patches are dated), open the Readme file to determine whether it is relevant to your environment.
The Readme file also contains installation instructions.
Duplicating IP Address/FQDN Objects
Duplicating URL Category Group Objects
Purpose: Duplicate an existing URL category group.
Select a URL category group.
A Dynamic Domain Name System (DDNS) automatically updates Internet DNS name servers in real-time to keep the active DNS configuration of host names, addresses, and other information up to date.
DDNS is typically used when businesses have frequent changes to the public host-name-to-IP-address mappings, usually when companies use PPPoE or DHCP to obtain Internet access.
Dynamic IP addresses present a problem if the customer wants to provide a service to other users on the Internet, such as a web service.
As the IP address may change frequently, corresponding domain names must be quickly re-mapped in the DNS, to maintain accessibility using a well-known URL.
The automatic reconfiguration is generally implemented in the user's router or computer, which runs software to update the DDNS service.
The communication between the user's equipment and the provider is not standardized, although a few standard web-based methods of updating have emerged over time (RFC 2136 or other protocols).
The appliance is designed as the first Internet-facing device an external client connects to when trying to reach the business, it needs to make sure that all Internet users route their traffic to it for each host name / domain that they are trying to reach on the business side.
Go to NetworkAddresses.
Edit the IP addresses.

This allows a method of user identification to be built using an IP address-to-user mapping cache for policy matching.
If a source IP address is not in the defined ranges within the selected address objects, the IP address will not work for endpoint identification.
For captive portal, if cannot associate the user with an IP address, a captive portal can take over and authenticate the user with a web form.
For transparent authentication, retrieves the authentication log information from the Domain Controller, which makes it possible to map a user to an IP address.
If this fails, directly connects to the client endpoint (the one trying to access a location outside the network) to query for the current logged-in user.
Endpoint identification mapping requires that the firewall obtain the source IP address of the user before the IP address is translated with NAT.
If multiple users appear to have the same source address, due to NAT or use of a proxy device, accurate user identification is not possible.

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack refers to an attack on a computer or network that causes a loss of "service," namely a network connection.
Domain Name system (DNS) is a general-purpose data query service chiefly used in the Internet for translating host names into IP addresses.
When a DNS client requests host name and address data from a DNS server, the process is called resolution.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a standard protocol used for transporting web pages (including graphics and multimedia content) from a server to a client over the Internet.
Occasionally a gateway or destination host uses Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) to communicate with a source host, for example, to report an error in datagram processing.
ICMP uses the basic support of IP as if it were a higher level protocol, however, ICMP is actually an integral part of IP, and implemented by every IP module.
ICMP messages are sent in several situations: for example, when a datagram cannot reach its destination, when the gateway does not have the buffering capacity to forward a datagram, and when the gateway can direct the host to send traffic on a shorter route.
The purpose of these control messages is to provide feedback about problems in the communication environment, not to make IP reliable.
Using IntelliScan provides the following benefits:
Shorter scanning period: Because IntelliScan uses true file type identification, it only scans files that are vulnerable to infection.
IntelliTrap helps reduce the risk of such viruses entering the network by blocking real-time compressed executable files and pairing them with other malware characteristics.
Because IntelliTrap identifies such files as security risks and may incorrectly block safe files, consider quarantining (not deleting or cleaning) files when you enable IntelliTrap.
The internet protocol (IP) provides for transmitting blocks of data called datagrams from sources to destinations, where sources and destinations are hosts identified by fixed length addresses.

How Cloud Edge Works
Deploy appliances to customer offices.
Use Remote Manager as a single point of entry to access graphical reports and summarized dashboard data for supported appliances and Trend Micro products.
After customers deploy on-premises, the customers configure each appliance as a firewall at the gateway or as a network bridge invisibly scanning and blocking malicious content.
Secure traffic forwarding through the cloud initiates after the MSP registers the appliance to Cloud Console as a registered gateway.
If the request is not allowed, for example a request to a forbidden URL category, the request is blocked and the user is notified.
MSPs can use Remote Manager to manage licensing and billing of multiple customers leveraging Trend Micro services: LMP (Licensing Management Portal) or CLP (Customer Licensing Portal).

IPsec Connections
VPN tunnel
An IPsec (or VPN) tunnel is a virtual interface on a security gateway associated with an existing VPN connection, and is used by IP routing as a point-to-point interface directly connected to a VPN peer gateway.
The routing table indicates that IP address X should be routed through a point-to-point link which is the VPN tunnel interface that is associated with peer gateway Y
The packet is encrypted using the proper IPsec authentication type parameters with peer gateway Y, and the new packet receives the peer gateway Y’s IP address as the destination IP
Based on the new destination IP, the packet is rerouted to the physical interface according to the appropriate routing table entry for Y’s address
The VPN kernel detects that a VPN tunnel interface exists for the peer VPN gateway, and reroutes the packet from the physical interface to the associated VPN tunnel interface

L2TP VPN
A L2TP VPN allows remote users to establish secure connections to the internal company network over a public network such as the Internet.
Security is ensured by encrypting the L2TP packets using IPsec before transporting the data to the end point over the L2TP tunnel.
Think of L2TP as the process that builds a tunnel, and IPsec packets as trucks that carry the encrypted data along the tunnel.
To send only traffic destined for internal networks through the VPN tunnel, you can configure the VPN for split-tunnel mode in the client's L2TP configuration.

Previously, all interfaces were enabled, regardless of whether the appliance was configured for Bridge Mode or for Routing Mode.
In Bridge Mode, only the Virtual Interface (br0) is visible and enabled as an L3 interface that can be assigned an IP address.
This can help prevent IP address conflicts when DHCP is used to assign an IP address to the Virtual Interface (br0).
The LAN2 (eth2) and LAN3 (eth3) interfaces are also enabled by default; however, they can be disabled if desired from the on-premises console.

Configure Virtual Private Network (VPN) with the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP), or Secure Sockets Layer Virtual Private Network (SSL VPN).
You can create a single peer-to-peer VPN tunnel, a star VPN topology with one central hub device and up to four spoke devices, or a full-mesh VPN topology of up to five devices.
The unit is invisible to the network and acts as a layer 2 bridge between network devices (switch, router, firewall, or endpoints), transparently scanning network traffic in both directions.
You only have to configure the bridge interface (br0) with an IP address that can provide connectivity to the Internet.
Bridge mode is the simplest way to deploy into an existing network topology and does not require client, router, or switch modifications.
All of its interfaces are on different subnets, enabling you to have a single IP address available to the public Internet.
in routing mode also provides Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) functionality to support dialing to the ISP through asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL).
You would typically use routing mode when the unit is deployed as a gateway between private and public networks.

Peer-to-Peer VPN Topology
Full-Mesh VPN Topology
Full-mesh VPNs are extremely reliable, because all the remote sites can still communicate even if the main site goes down.
Star VPN Topology
All remote sites can communicate directly with the central site; however, for communication from one remote site to another remote site, the IPsec traffic must travel to the central site and then the hub device routes traffic to the destination remote site.
A spoke device communicates with other spoke devices indirectly as all IPsec traffic is first sent to the hub device.
site-to-site VPN
A site-to-site Virtual Private Network (VPN) allows offices in multiple fixed locations to establish secure connections with each other over a public network such as the Internet.
An example of a company that needs a site-to-site VPN is a customer with dozens of branch offices around the world.
Think of IKE as the process that builds a tunnel, and IPSec packets as trucks that carry the encrypted data along the tunnel.
Interface mode, supported in NAT/Route mode only, creates a virtual interface for the local end of a VPN tunnel.

Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology is generally used to ensure that employees working off-site can remotely access their corporate network with appropriate security measures in place.
In general terms, authentication is the process of attempting to verify the (digital) identity for both accessing network resources and logging on the VPN network.
Based on standard secure Internet protocols, VPN implementation enables secure links between special types of network nodes, secure gateways.
Site-to-site VPN ensures secure links between gateways.

WRS Profiles
;Web Reputation Services (WRS) scrutinizes URLs before users access potentially dangerous websites, especially sites known to be phishing or pharming sites.
Employing WRS, provides real-time protection, conserves system scanning resources, and saves network bandwidth by preventing the infection chain or breaking it early.
Because a Web Reputation query returns URL category information (used by URL filtering), does not use a locally-stored, URL database.
For each accessed URL, queries Web Reputation for a reputation score and then takes the necessary action, based on whether this score is below or above the user-specified sensitivity level.
When a user attempts to access a URL, retrieves information about this URL from the web reputation database and stores it in the local cache.
Having the web reputation database on a remote server and building the local cache with this database information reduces the overhead on and improves performance.

New Feature 1:
Support for Configuring Interface MTU Value
You can use the Cloud Edge Cloud Console to configure the MTU/MSS for the LAN2 (eth2), LAN3 (eth3), and LAN4/MGMT (eth4) interfaces.
2.2 Enhancements
Enhancement 1:
Enhancements to HTTPS Inspection
With this enhancement, HTTPS traffic on ports 443 or 8443 that matches configured URL filtering or WRS can be evaluated and the appropriate action taken without decryption.
This HTTPS traffic can be evaluated and managed even if the HTTPS profile in the applied gateway protocol is disabled.
Previously, all interfaces were enabled, whether the Cloud Edge appliance was configured for Bridge Mode or for Routing Mode.
• In Bridge Mode, only the Virtual Interface (br0) is visible and enabled as an L3 interface that can be assigned an IP address.
The LAN2 (eth2) and LAN3 (eth3) interfaces must be enabled from the on-premises console before they can be configured as L2 or L3 interfaces with IP addresses.
This helps prevent IP address conflicts when DHCP is used to assign addresses to WAN1 (eth0) and WAN2/LAN1 (eth1).
2.3 Resolved Known Issues
Hot Fix 1562
Issue 1:
Solution 1:
This hotfix enables Cloud Edge to decrypt HTTPS traffic to the web server whose ports are 443 or 8443, even when the traffic is through a web proxy.
This hotfix resolves this issue by extending the maximum length of re-signed certificate that can be saved into the cache from 2048 bytes to 4096 bytes.
Some email messages are received multiple times in POP3 when users receive email messages that are larger than 10 MB.
This hotfix resolves this issue by enabling Cloud Edge to bypass large email messages and reset the cloud scan request.
This hotfix enables Cloud Edge to add Fully- Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) information in dpid logs generated when it skips HTTPS decryption because of bidirectional authentication.
This hotfix enables Cloud Edge to add an error log in the log file when it detects an abnormal URL category or application ID.
Cloud Edge cannot deploy policies to a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) object that contains a dash "-" because this kind of FQDN object does not pass validation.
This hotfix resolves this issue by changing a validation condition to support FQDN objects that contain a dash "-".
When Cloud Edge is not registered, eth2 to eth4 interfaces allow users to change their IPs to a different subnet even if the DHCP service is enabled in these interfaces.
This hotfix resolves this issue by ensuring that all interfaces do not allow changing the IP to a different subnet when the DHCP service is enabled.
This ensures that the DHCP IP range is in the same subnet with the DHCP server's interface IP and in a different subnet from other interfaces.
When a client sends both an "AUTH PLAIN" command and a user name to the server at the same time, CMSD is not able to retrieve the user name.
This hotfix resolves this issue by enabling the CMSD to support this type of "AUTH PLAIN" command and ensures that it does not block clients from receiving email messages when it receives an undefined value.
If "Use Ingress Interface IP" is selected for "Destination IP translation" when adding a DNAT rule on Cloud Edge Cloud Console in PPPoE mode, the DNAT setting does not work after Cloud Edge restarts because the PPPoE IP is not acquired when adding the DNAT rule.
This hotfix resolves this issue by enabling Cloud Edge to specify only the PPPoE interface instead of the PPPoE IP for this type of DNAT rules.
Users cannot send email messages if the SMTP server sends the greeting message by splitting the "\r\n" into two packets with only an "\r" and "\n" because CMSD drops the "\n" packet.
This hotfix resolves sample proxies and widgets, authentication, and web access permission vulnerabilities in the Widget Framework used for the dashboard in the on-premises console of Cloud Edge 5.0 Service Pack 1.
When handling SMTP, Cloud Edge splits multiline responses into several packets; however, some non-RFC-compliant email clients do not wait for the succeeding packets after receiving the first packet, so these email clients are not able to send email messages.
This hotfix enables Cloud Edge to keep multiline responses in a single packet to ensure that affected email clients receive the responses successfully.
This hotfix reduces the number of objects in the "IpsProfile" object of the configuration file to help ensure that the memcached mechanism can load the setting values and that the "IpsProfile" object is not lost in the process.
This hotfix adds an error handling mechanism to help ensure successful policy deployment when the "IpsProfile" object is missing from the configuration file.
If Cloud Edge queries the URL category for a specific URL and the WRS response does not contain this information, Cloud Edge holds data packets and tries to send the request again.
This hotfix resolves this issue by preventing Cloud Edge from holding data packets once it receives a response from WRS even when the response does not contain the URL category information.

This issue happens because access to the Cloud Edge SSL VPN with Chrome/Firefox requires that Java be installed and supported by Chrome/Firefox.
However, support for NPADI was dropped from Chrome/Firefox starting with Chrome 45 and Firefox 52, which impacts plug-ins for Java, Silverlight, and other similar NPAPI-based plug-ins.
Because of a limitation in the Microsoft Windows native L2TP client, only one Windows native client behind the same NAT server can dial-in. There is no impact to Linux/Mac/Mobile L2TP clients.
If web traffic or email traffic uses SSLv3 or earlier versions, traffic is bypassed by the Cloud Edge appliance.

Enhancement 5: LDAP Integration Removed
Hot Fix 1125
Issue 1: In Bridge Mode on Cloud Edge 50E and Cloud Edge 70E, the management interface (eth4) is down.
Solution 1: This hotfix enables the management interface for Bridge Mode on Cloud Edge 50E and Cloud Edge 70E.
Issue 1: If a bug in the Linux kernel's multicast_snooping function is triggered, Cloud Edge will drop ICMPv6 NS packets and clients will not be able to communicate with the IPv6 router through Cloud Edge in Bridge Mode.
Issue 1: After restarting in Bridge Mode, Cloud Edge stops sending VLAN packets to Netfilter until policies have been deployed.
Solution 1: This hotfix enables Cloud Edge to keep sending VLAN packets to Netfilter immediately after restarting in Bridge Mode so that mail and HTTPS traffic can go through the VLAN normally.
Issue 1: Cloud Edge Deep Packet Inspection Daemon (DPID) holds HTTP 3xx responses during VSAPI scanning until it times out.
Issue 2: If the response of RETR command only includes the "+OK\r\n" string, the Cloud Message Scan Daemon (CMSD) cannot parse the response.
Solution 2: This hotfix resolves the issue by adding a handler for responses that only include the "+OK\r\n" string.
Solution 1: This hotfix resolves this issue by not holding an HTTP response if the content-length is less than 48 bytes.
Issue 2: Cloud Edge sometimes records the email bandwidth log at a later time than the actual time it occurred.

Policy rules (application control, URL filtering, firewall)
From the Policies screen, you can manage Cloud Console policy rules, policy objects, the approved and blocked lists, gateway profiles, and user notifications.
You can fine-tune policy controls by configuring gateway profiles for IPS, anti-malware security, web reputation, email security, HTTPS inspection, denial of service attacks, and endpoint identification.
If the monitoring IP addresses of one interface are unavailable, all policy-based routes associated with that interface are disabled.
You can configure IPv4 policy-based routes if you want to manually control how traffic is routed in your environment.
When new IPv4 static routes are added, checks whether a matching route and destination already exist in the routing table.

Internet Control Message Protocol for IPv6
Configure the management interface to allow or block specific types of management services (or traffic) that originates from IPv4 devices behind the appliance.
Once the Global Anti-Malware security profile is enabled in a policy, network-connection scans ensure web-based content is malware free.
The conventional anti-malware scanner scans IPv6 traffic.
At the core of this solution is an advanced scanning architecture that leverages the Smart Scan server to perform threat scanning of IPv4 and IPv6 traffic using signatures that are stored in the cloud.
For approved and blocked list entries used in Bridge Mode and Software Switch deployments, you can add both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
For approved and blocked list entries used in Routing Mode deployments, you can add IPv4 addresses and FQDNs and URL entries must resolve to IPv4 addresses.
Similar to policy rules, bandwidth control can limit traffic based on source or destination IP address, application or service, and time of day.
To achieve this, you can use the gateway policy rules to bypass scanning on all but the closest gateway to the IPsec traffic.
The IP address assigned to br0 is used for cloud-based Cloud Message Scan (CMS), to manage for scheduled pattern updates, and to leverage the real-time security information power of the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network in the cloud.
lCommand & Control (C&C) Information Pattern provides with enhanced detection and alert capabilities to mitigate the damage caused by advanced persistent threats and targeted attacks.
The appliance can now execute policies based on the user information for any applications passing through the appliance, not just for applications that use a web browser.
If the above-mentioned Captive Portal rules do not apply because the traffic is not HTTP or there is no rule match, then the appliance applies its IP address-based security policies.

routing mode, bridge mode, software switch overview
These modes control how the appliance routes network packets and interfaces perform forwarding decisions.
The bridge interface is used to connect to Cloud Console, to provide Cloud Message Scan services, and to provide access to other cloud services such as Trend Micro ActiveUpdate.
Bridge Mode is the simplest way to deploy into an existing network topology and does not require client, router, or switch modifications.
The unit is visible to the network and acts as a layer 3 routing device - a gateway between a private network and the Internet.
in Routing Mode also provides Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) functionality to support dialing to the ISP through asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL).
You would typically use a Routing Mode deployment when the unit is deployed as a gateway between private and public networks.
Similar to Bridge Mode, all of its interfaces are on the same subnet and you can configure only the bridge virtual interface (br0) with an IP address.
The br0 interface provides connectivity to the Internet.
However, with a Software Switch deployment, all ports besides the uplink port are connected directly to end points such as clients, servers, and Wi-Fi access routers.
You would typically use a Software Switch deployment when operates on a private network behind an existing firewall or router and you want to connect end points directly to the appliance.
Certain gateway features that rely on layer 3 networking such as VPN or NAT are not available in Bridge Mode or Software Switch.
These configurations control how the appliance routes network packets and interfaces perform forwarding decisions.
The default deployment mode for all appliance models is Bridge Mode.
Each interface that has DHCP services enabled acts as a DHCP server that can assign IPv4 addresses and other network settings such as a default gateway and DNS settings to internal clients.
automatically responds to DHCP requests directed to interfaces configured with DHCP services.
When assigning DNS addresses to a client, you can configure DHCP to use the system DNS settings, the interface IPv4 address, or you can manually specify a list of DNS IPv4 addresses.
You can configure the IPv4 address pool that the DHCP server can use to assign addresses to the DHCP clients.
You can create a separate DHCP pool for each interface.
Smart Protection Network (SPN) uses cloud-based services and relies on DNS queries for lookups.
Since environments that utilize DHCP or PPPoE to access the Internet might dynamically acquire the DNS configuration from the ISP, you might not be required to configure DNS settings in these environments.

DHCP settings using Cloud Edge Cloud Console
For a Software Switch deployment, the appliance mode switch is set to Bridge Mode and you configure the bridge virtual interface (br0) with IP address settings the same as you do with the basic Bridge Mode configuration.
You must additionally add at least three physical interfaces to act as the L2 interfaces of a software switch.
WAN (eth0) and LAN1 (eth1) are required ports.
You can add either LAN2 (eth2), and LAN3 (eth3) as the third software switch interface.
You can add both the LAN2 (eth2), and LAN3 (eth3) ports if desired.
Choose the Mode used to configure the br0 interface.
The default is 1438.
The range is 576-1500.
You can also modify the MTU of the physical interfaces on the appliance.
The MTU configured for the software switch cannot be larger than the MTU configured on the physical interfaces.
If Mode is Static configure the applicable br0 IPv4 interface settings.
If the gateway is not registered, configure administrative access for the br0 interface.

The only configurable interface is br0 (Virtual Interface), which you must configure from the on-premises console.
The Interface 1 and Interface 2 fields are read-only and preset as L2 interface with WAN [L2] and LAN1 [L2] pre-selected respectively.
The br0 interface can use static or DHCP addressing.
For DHCP, configure the applicable parameters:
editing eth0 and eth1 interfaces using on-premises console
After the appliance is registered to Cloud Console, you can edit only the WAN1 (eth0) and WAN2/LAN1 (eth1) interfaces from the on-premises console.
The eth0 (WAN1) and eth1 (WAN2/LAN1) interfaces can use static, DHCP, or PPPoE addressing.
If any of the hosts are unavailable, disables the static routes or policy-based routes associated with the interface.
After the gateway is registered, you must configure eth2 (LAN2), eth3 (LAN3), and eth4 (LAN4/MGMT) with static IPv4 addresses.
If the gateways is configured as a Software Switch (a variation of Bridge Mode), you can configure only eth4 (LAN4/MGMT) from Cloud Console.

If nothing is specified, all IPv4 addresses are allowed.
Software Switch: eth2 (LAN2) and eth3 (LAN3) are automatically enabled when you add them as a software switch interface.
You can configure general settings that specify how should manage the TTL for the authentication cache.
Endpoint Identification identifies which IPv4 address belongs to which user.
This allows a method of user identification to be built using an IPv4 address-to-user mapping cache for policy matching.
By default, Endpoint Identification cannot automatically identify IPv4 addresses.
You must specify which IP addresses or IP address ranges to use when using Endpoint Identification.
If a source IPv4 address is not in the defined ranges within the defined address objects, the IPv4 address will not work for Endpoint Identification.
If cannot associate the user with an IPv4 address, Captive Portal can take over and authenticate the user with a web form (if enabled).
Endpoint Identification mapping requires that the firewall obtain the source IPv4 address of the user before the IPv4 address is translated with NAT.
IPv6 addresses cannot be used for Endpoint Identification.
For IPv6 traffic, the Captive Portal page does not open and IPv6 traffic will pass.
In a pure IPv4 environment, Endpoint Identification works normally.
In a mixed IPv4 and IPv6 environment, IPv4 traffic triggers Endpoint Identification, but IPv6 traffic does not trigger Endpoint Identification.
In a pure IPv6 environment, IPv6 traffic does not trigger Endpoint Identification.

You can add MAC addresses or IPv4 addresses (single or range).
Maximum entries is 256.
If the compliance check finds that an end-point in the protection list is non-compliant, can take one of two courses of action:
All access to the Internet is blocked.
Exceptions: Clients are not blocked if the traffic/URLs are in the global approved list.
Traffic to DNS and DHCP are not blocked.
If you set the action for clients without agents to , clients without agents cannot access the Internet.
If a user attempts to install agent on these clients, the following URLs should be added to Approved List; otherwise, installation might fail.
In addition, if a user accesses the Trend Micro CLP site on a client without an agent, the following URLs should be added to Approved List; otherwise, the following access requests might be affected: www.google-analytics.com/*www.googletagmanager.com/*
Access to the Internet is allowed, but access is logged in the troubleshooting page along with the reason that the end point is out-of-compliance.
You can use the Client List section to view all end-point clients detected by the appliance over the last 24 hours.
After you enable and click on Apply to deploy the update to the appliance, the appliance begins to tabulate information about clients that have had traffic pass through the appliance over the past 24 hours.
For convenience, the clients initially detected after deployment are automatically added to the protection list.

About Plug-in Manager
To help ease the management of these solutions, Plug-in Manager provides at-a-glance data for the solutions in the form of widgets.
The server can download these solutions but is not able to deploy the solutions to pure IPv6 trend_client_program_plural or pure IPv6 hosts.
Plug-in Manager delivers the following:
In this release, two features fall under this category, namely, Trend Micro Virtual Desktop Support and OfficeScan Data Protection.
Plug-in programs
Dashboard tabs and widgets
The plug_in_prog_parent_program Summary screen requires Plug-in Manager to display the tabs and widgets used to monitor the plug_in_prog_parent_program server and agent protection status.
This document provides a general overview of plug-in program installation and management and discusses plug-in program data available in widgets.
About the product_short_name Firewall
The product_short_name firewall protects client_computer_plural and servers on the network using stateful inspection and high performance network virus scanning.
Through the central management console, you can create rules to filter connections by application, IP address, port number, or protocol, and then apply the rules to different groups of users.
You can enable, configure, and use the product_short_name firewall on Windows XP computer_device_plural that also have Windows Firewall enabled.
Because the web threat is in a fixed location of a website rather than on an infected computer_device, the web threat creator constantly modifies its code to avoid detection.
Among other impacts, this threat has the potential to erode confidence in web commerce, corrupting the trust needed for Internet transactions.
The second goal is to hijack a user’s CPU power to use it as an instrument to conduct profitable activities.
About Windows 8/8.1/10 and Windows Server 2012/2016
Windows 8/8.1 and Windows Server 2012/2016 provide users with two types of operating modes: desktop mode and Windows UI mode.
The Windows UI mode provides users with a new user interface experience similar to that used on Windows phones.

Activating the plug_in_prog_prod_name_titles License
Integrate product_short_name with your Microsoft Active Directory structure to manage trend_client_program_plural more efficiently, assign web console permissions using Active Directory accounts, and determine which agents do not have security software installed.
Custom agent groups: Use Active Directory or IP addresses to manually group agents and map them to domains in the product_short_name agent tree.
Unmanaged endpoints: Ensure that endpoints in the network that are not managed by the product_short_name server comply with your company's security guidelines.
Active Directory Logs
Active Directory logs
All product_short_name servers must be part of an Active Directory domain to take advantage of the Role-based Administration and Security Compliance features.
Customizing scan actions requires knowledge about virus/malware and can be a tedious task. product_name uses ActiveAction to counter these issues.
ActiveUpdate Server as the trend_client_program_single_cap Update Source
When trend_client_program_plural download updates directly from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server, you can limit the download to only the pattern files to reduce the bandwidth consumed during updates and speed up the update process.
A dual-stack proxy server that can convert IP addresses, such as DeleGate, is required to allow the trend_client_program_plural to connect to the ActiveUpdate server.
Connected to the company_name update website, ActiveUpdate provides up-to-date downloads of pattern files, scan engines, programs, and other company_name component files through the Internet.
Go to OSCE User Accounts.
The Step 1 User Information screen appears.
product_short_name sends notifications to this email address.
Define the client_computer_single tree scope by selecting the root domain, or one or several domains in the client_computer_single tree.
The client_computer_single tree scope you configured in step 8 determines the level of permission to the menu items and defines the targets for the permission.
client_computer_single_cap Tree Scope
Root domain (all client_computer_plural) or specific domains
If the targets are Domains A and B, the tasks can only be initiated on client_computer_plural in Domains A and B.
The client_computer_single tree will only display if the permission to the Client Tree menu item in "Menu Items for Servers/client_computer_plural_cap" is "View".
Go to OSCE User Roles.
Go to OSCE Firewall Policies.
Select the action product_short_name will perform on network traffic (block or allow traffic that meets the exception criteria) and the traffic direction (inbound or outbound network traffic on the trend_client_program_single computer_device).
For example, if you chose to deny all network traffic (inbound and outbound) and type the IP address for a single computer_device on the network, then any trend_client_program_single that has this exception in its policy will not be able to send or receive data to or from that IP address.
All IP addresses: Includes all IP addresses
If the administrator enables all the firewall features and grants trend_client_program_single users the privilege to configure firewall settings, users can enable/disable the features and modify firewall settings in the trend_client_program_single console.
If you do not enable the features, the firewall settings you configure from the product_short_name web console display under Network card list on the trend_client_program_single console.
The information under Settings on the trend_client_program_single console's Firewall tab always reflects the settings configured from the trend_client_program_single console, not from the server web console.
Go to OSCE Firewall Profiles.
If you typed a particular NIC model, such as "Intel(R) Pro/100", only NIC descriptions that start with "Intel(R) Pro/100" will satisfy the criteria.
Adding Active Directory Accounts or Groups
Select Active Directory user or group.
If you do not specify the wildcard character, include the complete account name. product_short_name will not return a result for incomplete account names or if the default group "Domain Users" is used.

A user will have read and write access to any file on the USB storage device that is accessed from Microsoft Word.
For example, if you want to allow users to install software from a CD, add the installation program path and name, such as "E:\Installer\Setup.exe", to this list.
Consider the data lock feature in a USB storage device, which, if enabled, prompts users for a valid user name and password before the device can be unlocked.
The data lock feature uses a program on the device called "Password.exe", which must be allowed to execute so that users can unlock the device successfully.
"Password.exe" must also have read and write access to the device so that users can change the user name or password.
Basic Criteria: Includes basic information about computer_device_plural such as IP address, operating system, domain, MAC address, scan method, and web reputation status

If you have more than one product_short_name server on the network, use the Agent Mover tool to transfer trend_client_program_plural from one product_short_name server to another.
This is especially useful after adding a new product_short_name server to the network and you want to transfer existing trend_client_program_plural to the new server.
If you use Agent Mover to move any trend_client_program_single running an earlier version to a server of the current version, the trend_client_program_single will be upgraded automatically.
Agent Proxy Settings conref
For example, a user who frequently gives presentations can enable Independent mode before starting a presentation to prevent the product_short_name server from deploying trend_client_program_single settings and initiating scans on the trend_client_program_single.
When trend_client_program_plural are in Independent mode:
trend_client_program_plural do not send logs to the product_short_name server, even if there is a functional connection between the server and agents.
The product_short_name server does not initiate tasks and deploy trend_client_program_single settings to the agents, even if there is functional connection between the server and agents.
trend_client_program_single self-protection provides ways for the trend_client_program_single to protect the processes and other resources required to function properly. trend_client_program_single self-protection helps thwart attempts by programs or actual users to disable anti-malware protection.
In the agent tree, click the root domain icon () to include all agents or select specific domains or agents.

Apache Uninstallation Warning
When upgrading to product_short_name product_version, a warning displays if the previous OfficeScan server has the Apache web server configured. product_short_name no longer supports the Apache web server.
If you installed the Apache web server using the Setup program in the previous version of OfficeScan, product_short_name can automatically uninstall the web server and install the IIS web server during installation.
If you manually installed the Apache web server before installing the previous version of OfficeScan, you must manually uninstall the Apache web server before continuing to upgrade the product_short_name server.
This warning does not display if you configured the previous version of the OfficeScan server with the IIS web server.

product_short_name allows you to configure scan exclusion settings for a particular scan type and then apply the same settings to all the other scan types.
On January 1, product_short_name administrator Chris found out that there are a large number of JPG files on client_computer_single computers and realized that these files do not pose any security threat.
Chris added JPG in the file exclusion list for Manual Scan and then applied this setting to all scan types.
A week later, Chris removed JPG from the exclusion list for Real-time Scan but did not apply scan exclusion settings to all scan types.
Assigning trend_client_program_plural_cap as Update Agents
OfficeScan agent programs and hot fixes
When deciding on whether to use a single authentication key across all product_short_name servers, take note of the following:
After the new installation completes, import the backed up certificate to allow communication authentication between the product_short_name server and trend_client_program_plural to continue uninterrupted.
If you create a new certificate during server installation, trend_client_program_plural cannot authenticate server communication because they are still using the old certificate (which no longer exists).
Automatic Proxy Settings for the trend_client_program_single_cap
automatic proxy settings
When enabled, automatic proxy settings are the primary proxy settings when trend_client_program_plural update components either through automatic update or Update Now.
If trend_client_program_plural cannot connect using the automatic proxy settings, client_computer_single users with the privilege to configure proxy settings can use user-configured proxy settings.
Proxy authentication is not supported.
Go to OSCE Inactive Endpoints.
product_short_name stops scanning when the specified amount of time is exceeded and scanning is not yet complete. product_short_name immediately notifies users of any security risk detected during scanning.
This allows you to restore the file in case you need it in the future. product_short_name encrypts the backup file to prevent it from being opened, and then stores the file on the \Backup folder.

Upgrade the product_name server.
If you encounter upgrade issues, copy the backup files from step 3 to the \PCCSRV folder on the target endpoint and restart the OfficeScan Master Service.
Backing up the product_short_name Database
Go to OSCE Database Backup.
The folder name indicates the time of the backup and is in the following format: YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS. product_short_name preserves the 7 most recent backup folders, automatically deleting older folder(s).
If the backup path is on a remote computer (using a UNC path), type an appropriate account name and the corresponding password.
Files with the RB0~RB9 extensions are backup copies of infected files. product_short_name creates a backup of the infected file in case the virus/malware damaged the file during the cleaning process.
In this scenario, the computer_device that meets the product_short_name system requirements and has adequate resources is a prime candidate for the installation of the product_short_name server.
Before Uninstalling the product_short_name Server
Before Upgrading the product_short_name Server and Agents
If you have enabled the product_short_name firewall in your current product_short_name version, deploying the package may cause the following agent endpoint disruptions:
An option on the product_short_name web console, which is enabled by default, postpones the Common Firewall Driver update until the agent endpoint is restarted.
After deploying the package, the product_short_name TDI driver's previous version still exists on the agent endpoint and the new version is not loaded until the endpoint is restarted.
If the option to display the restart notification message is enabled on the web console, users are prompted to restart.
For OfficeScan 10.x versions:
Go to Networked Computers Global Client Settings.
Go to OSCE Client Settings.
For example, open Windows Task Manager and verify that CPU usage for DbServer.exe is 00. If CPU usage is higher, wait until usage is 00, which signals that database-related tasks have been completed.
An approved program will still be checked by other product_short_name features (such as file-based scanning) before it is finally allowed to run.
Go to HKLM\SOFTWARE\TrendMicro\Aegis.
Any trend_client_program_single that runs continuously aggregates the logs and sends them at specified intervals, which is every 60 minutes by default.
If client_computer_plural have the Behavior Monitoring privileges, the Behavior Monitoring option displays on the Settings screen on the trend_client_program_single console.
Blocking Access to Data Recorders (CD/DVD)
Go to OSCE DP Client Management.
Click Settings DLP Settings.
Configure client_computer_single location settings if you have not done so. client_computer_plural_cap use these location settings to determine the correct Data Loss Prevention policy to apply.
For example, if you block the trusted port, product_short_name cannot communicate with the agent for the duration of the outbreak.
Any port between 1 and 65535, or a port range: Optionally specify the direction of the traffic to block and some comments, such as the reason for blocking the ports you specified.

Command & Control Contact Alert Services
Trend Micro Command & Control (C&C) Contact Alert Services provides enhanced detection and alert capabilities to mitigate the damage caused by advanced persistent threats and targeted attacks.
C&C Contact Alert Services are integrated with Web Reputation Services which determines the action taken on detected callback addresses based on the web reputation security level.
C&C Contact Alert Services Features
Trend Micro Smart Protection Network compiles the Global Intelligence list from sources all over the world and tests and evaluates the risk level of each C&C callback address.
The web reputation security level determines the action taken on malicious websites or C&C servers based on assigned risk levels.
The Virtual Analyzer populates the Virtual Analyzer list with any threat that attempts to connect to a possible C&C server.
product_short_name retrieves the list from Virtual Analyzer and can evaluate all possible C&C threats against both the Global Intelligence and the local Virtual Analyzer list.
CCCA_Events Widget
This widget displays all C&C callback event information including the target of the attack and the source callback address.
To select the list source (Global Intelligence, Virtual Analyzer), click the edit icon ( ) and select the list from the C&C list source drop-down.
C&C Address Information
If the security level is set to Medium or High, product_short_name will still allow applications to run and access the network.
Incorrect proxy settings, along with an intermittent Internet connection, can result in delays or failure to receive a response from company_name datacenters, causing monitored programs to appear unresponsive.
A dual-stack proxy server that can convert IP addresses, such as DeleGate, is required to allow the trend_client_program_plural to connect to the company_name datacenters.
Go to OSCE AV Management.
Changing the VDI Scan Capacity
Administrators can increase the number of VDI endpoints that run concurrent scanning by modifying the vdi.ini file. company_name recommends strictly monitoring the effect of changing the VDI capacity to ensure that system resources can handle any increased scanning.
Locate the [TaskController] settings.
The default TaskController settings are as follows:
For OfficeScan 10.5 clients:
Save and close the vdi.ini file.
Modify the controller settings further to increase/decrease the number of concurrent scans to best suit the VDI environment by repeating steps 1 to 5.
product_short_name installs with default settings.
Refer to the OfficeScan Server Help and Administrator’s Guide for details on the settings available on the web console.
Check the action OfficeScan performs on infected files by going to OSCE AV Management > SettingsScan Settings {Scan Type}Action tab.
This is because product_short_name needs to decompress the compressed file, clean/delete infected files within the compressed file, and then re-compress the file.
The compressed file format is supported. product_short_name only supports certain compressed file formats, including ZIP and Office Open XML, which uses ZIP compression technologies.
After Real-time Scan decompresses a compressed file named abc.zip and detects an infected file 123.doc within the compressed file, product_short_name deletes 123.doc and then re-compresses abc.zip, which is now safe to access.
Action OfficeScan is set to perform
Example: def.rar contains an infected file 123.doc.
Example: abc.zip contains an infected file 123.doc.
Deny Access: product_short_name denies access to abc.zip when it is opened (123.doc and all non-infected files cannot be opened).

For administrators using other virtualization applications, the product_short_name server can also act as an emulated hypervisor to manage virtual agents.
Use the product_short_name VDI Pre-Scan Template Generation Tool to optimize on-demand scan or remove GUIDs from base or golden images.
Full patterns on the product_short_name server
If the difference between the two versions is 14 or less, the server only downloads the incremental pattern that accounts for the difference between the two versions.
If the difference is more than 14, the server automatically downloads the full version of the pattern file and 14 incremental patterns.
The difference between versions 171 and 175 is 2. In other words, the server does not have versions 173 and 175.
The server downloads incremental pattern 171.175.
Because the server has pattern versions 169, 167, 165, 163, 161, 159, it can generate the following incremental patterns:
169.175, 167.175, 165.175, 163.175, 161.175, 159.175
The server now has 7 incremental patterns:
171.175, 169.175, 167.175, 165.175, 163.175, 161.175, 159.175
It removes any older version (version 159).

Configure SNMP Trap notification settings.
In the Virus/Malware Log Bandwidth Settings section, configure the Enable the OfficeScan agent to create a single virus/malware log entry for recurring detections of the same virus/malware within an hour setting.
product_short_name consolidates virus log entries when detecting multiple infections from the same virus/malware over a short period of time. product_short_name may detect a single virus/malware multiple times, quickly filling the virus/malware log and consuming network bandwidth when the trend_client_program_single sends log information to the server.
Enabling this feature helps reduce both the number of virus/malware log entries made and the amount of network bandwidth trend_client_program_plural consume when they report virus log information to the server.
When this setting is enabled, all trend_client_program_plural managed by the server add a Scan with OfficeScan option to the right-click menu in Windows Explorer.

The same is true for IPv4 client_computer_plural.
product_short_name accepts standard IPv6 address presentations.
Exercise caution when specifying a link-local IPv6 address because even though product_short_name can accept the address, it might not work as expected under certain circumstances.
For example, trend_client_program_plural cannot update from an update source if the source is on another network segment and is identified by its link-local IPv6 address.
For configurations that require the server to query IP addresses, prefix length restrictions apply to prevent performance issues that may occur when the server queries a significant number of IP addresses.
For example, for the Outside Server Management feature, the prefix length can only be between 112 (65,536 IP addresses) and 128 (2 IP addresses).
Some settings that involve IPv6 addresses or address ranges will be deployed to trend_client_program_plural but trend_client_program_plural will ignore them.
For example, if you configured the smart protection source list and included a Smart Protection Server identified by its IPv6 address, pure IPv4 trend_client_program_plural will ignore the server and connect to the other smart protection sources.
Go to OSCE Client Location.
If you did not specify a reference server, the trend_client_program_single checks the connection status with the product_short_name server when the following events occur:

product_short_name applies firewall profiles to trend_client_program_plural in the order in which the profiles appear in the profile list.
For example, if the agent matches the first profile, product_short_name applies the actions configured for that profile to the agent. product_short_name ignores the other profiles configured for that agent.
Reference servers are endpoints that act as substitutes for the product_short_name server when it applies firewall profiles.
A reference server can be any endpoint on the network (see for more information). product_short_name makes the following assumptions when you enable reference servers:
trend_client_program_plural connected to reference servers are online, even if the agents cannot communicate with the product_short_name server.
Firewall profiles applied to online trend_client_program_plural also apply to trend_client_program_plural connected to reference servers.
To save the current settings and assign the profiles to trend_client_program_plural:
Click Assign Profile to Agents. product_short_name assigns all profiles on the profile list to all the trend_client_program_plural.
To verify that you successfully assigned profiles to trend_client_program_plural:
Select Monitor firewall violations on OfficeScan agents.
Specify the number of IDS logs, firewall logs, and network virus logs.
product_short_name sends a notification message when the number of logs is exceeded.
For example, if you specify 100 IDS logs, 100 firewall logs, 100 network virus logs, and a time period of 3 hours, product_short_name sends the notification when the server receives 301 logs within a 3-hour period.
Token Variables for Firewall Violation Outbreak Notifications

Let agents initiate component update after restarting and connecting to the OfficeScan server (Independent agents excluded)
The configuration file contains all trend_client_program_single settings configured using the web console.
company_name often updates components; however, product_short_name configuration settings probably change less frequently.
Updating the configuration files with the components requires more bandwidth and increases the time product_short_name needs to complete the update.
For this reason, company_name recommends updating trend_client_program_single configurations only once per day.
Specify the time of the update and the time period the product_short_name server notifies agents to update components.
For example, if the start time is 12pm and the time period is 2 hours, product_short_name randomly notifies all online agents to update components from 12pm until 2pm.
For details on enabling scheduled-based updates, see step 4 of .
product_short_name cannot notify offline agents immediately.
Select Let agents initiate component update after restarting and connecting to the OfficeScan server (Independent agents excluded) to update offline agents that become online after the time period expires.

Configuring Web Console Settings
Go to OSCE Web Console Settings.
Select Enable automatic log out from the web console and then select the timeout interval.
Connecting to the Edge Relay Server
After installing the Edge Relay Server, you must configure the Edge Relay Server connection settings on the product_short_name server.
After connecting to the Edge Relay Server, trend_client_program_plural reporting to the product_short_name server receive the connection settings and can automatically communicate to the Edge Relay Server after leaving the corporate intranet.
On the product_short_name web console, go to Administration Settings Edge Relay.
The Edge Relay Settings screen appears.
Type the IP address and Port of the Edge Relay Server.
Ensure that you provide the IP address and port that you configured for intranet communication with the Edge Relay Server.
If your environment requires a proxy server to communicate with the Edge Relay Server in the demilitarized zone, enable Connect using external proxy server settings.
To configure the external proxy settings, click external proxy server settings to redirect to the Proxy Settings screen.
Configure the necessary proxy information under the OfficeScan Server Updates section.
Upon successful connection with the Edge Relay Server, the screen refreshes with the connection information.
product_short_name keeps connection verification logs to allow you to determine whether or not the product_short_name server can communicate with all of its registered client_computer_plural. product_short_name creates a log entry each time you verify client_computer_single-server connection from the web console.
Considerations When Using Vulnerability Scanner
Vulnerability Scanner
To help you decide whether to use Vulnerability Scanner, consider the following:
The trend_client_program_single Console Flyover will open when hovering your mouse pointer over the small icon on the bottom right of the trend_client_program_single console.
Connected to the prod_server_name
Not connected to the prod_server_name, but real-time scan is still running.
Right-click the agent icon in the Windows Task Bar and click Update Now.
Unable to connect to the Scan Server or Smart Protection Network; protection is reduced as trend_client_program_plural are unable to send scan queries.
Verify that the Smart Scan service TMiCRCScanService is running and that trend_client_program_plural are connected to the prod_server_name.
IM Content Filtering
Control Manager Certificate Authorization
Before registering product_short_name to the control_manager_prod server, you must first obtain the control_manager_prod certificate file from the control_manager_prod server from the following location:
product_short_name and control_manager_prod use the certificate and public key encryption to ensure that only authorized registration and policy management communication occurs between the servers.
If your company uses a customized certificate on the control_manager_prod server, you must upload the Root CA certificate during the control_manager_prod registration.
control_manager_prod Integration in this product_short_name Release
integration with OfficeScan
This product_short_name release includes the following features and capabilities when managing product_short_name servers from control_manager_prod:
Create, manage, and deploy policies for product_name Antivirus, Data Loss Prevention, and Device Control, and assign privileges directly to trend_client_program_plural from the control_manager_prod console.
The following table lists the policy configurations available in control_manager_prod 6.0 SP3 Patch 2.

Any of the following icons displays when trend_client_program_plural use conventional scan.
Connection with product_short_name Server
Unavailable, reconnecting to sources
Conventional Scan is the scan method used in all earlier product_short_name versions.
A Conventional Scan client_computer_single stores all product_short_name components on the client_computer_single computer_device and scans all files locally.
CPU usage
product_short_name can pause after scanning one file and before scanning the next file.
Medium: Pause between file scans if CPU consumption is higher than 50%, and do not pause if 50% or lower
Low: Pause between file scans if CPU consumption is higher than 20%, and do not pause if 20% or lower
When CPU consumption begins to exceed the threshold, product_short_name pauses to reduce CPU usage, and stops pausing when consumption is within the threshold again.
If you choose High, product_short_name does not check the actual CPU consumption and scans files without pausing.
To manually backup the forensic data database, navigate to \PCCSRV\Private.
Copy the DLPForensicDataTracker.db file to a new location.
Creating a Disk Image of the trend_client_program_single_cap
Install the trend_client_program_single on the computer_device.
Copy ImgSetup.exe from \PCCSRV\Admin\Utility\ImgSetup to this computer_device.
Run ImgSetup.exe on this computer_device.
This creates a RUN registry key under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.
Create a disk image of the trend_client_program_single using the disk imaging software.
ImgSetup.exe automatically starts and creates one new GUID value.
The trend_client_program_single reports this new GUID to the server and the server creates a new record for the new trend_client_program_single.
To avoid having two computers with the same name in the product_short_name database, manually change the computer_device name or domain name of the cloned trend_client_program_single.
TCacheGenCli Generate_Template
TcacheGenCli_x64 Generate_Template
The tool scans the image for security threats before generating the pre-scan template and removing the GUID.
After generating the pre-scan template, the tool unloads the trend_client_program_single.
Do not reload the trend_client_program_single.
If the trend_client_program_single reloads, you will need to create the pre-scan template again.
On the product_short_name server computer, browse to \PCCSRV\Admin\Utility\ClientPackager.
Double-click ClnPack.exe to run the tool.
The package installs the trend_client_program_single program with the components currently available on the server.
Select MSI to create a package that conforms to the Microsoft Installer Package format.
The package also installs the trend_client_program_single program with the components currently available on the server.
If the target computer_device has an earlier client_computer_single version installed, running the MSI file upgrades the client_computer_single.
Allow the agent to report its domain automatically: After installing the trend_client_program_single, the client_computer_single queries the product_short_name server database and reports its domain settings to the server.
Any domain in the list: Agent Packager synchronizes with the product_short_name server and lists the domains currently used in the client_computer_single tree.
If the target computer_device does not have the trend_client_program_single installed, the package first scans the computer_device for security risks before installing the trend_client_program_single.

After upgrading the product_short_name server, you must edit custom accounts and manually enable all new features on the Step 3 Define Agent Tree Menu screen for previously added custom accounts.
Only users with the built-in administrator role and those using the root account created during product_short_name installation can create custom user roles and assign these roles to user accounts.
The product_short_name firewall gives you the ability to configure policies to block or allow specified types of network traffic.
Assign a policy to one or more profiles, which you can then deploy to specified trend_client_program_plural.
Customized DLP Templates
A template combines data identifiers and logical operators (And, Or, Except) to form condition statements.
For more information and examples on how condition statements and logical operators work, see .
Perle Compatible Regular Expressions
Note that Data Loss Prevention follows the expression formats defined in Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE).
For more information on PCRE, visit the following website:
An expression must satisfy the chosen criteria before Data Loss Prevention subjects it to a DLP policy.
All keywords within characters
In addition, each keyword pair must be within characters of each other.
For example, your 3 keywords are WEB, DISK, and USB and the number of characters you specified is 20.
If Data Loss Prevention detects all keywords in the order DISK, WEB, and USB, the number of characters from the "D" (in DISK) to the "W" (in WEB) and from the "W" to the "U" (in USB) must be 20 characters or less.
The following data does not match the criteria: DISK*******************WEB****USB(23 characters between "D" and "W")
When deciding on the number of characters, remember that a small number, such as 10, usually results in a faster scanning time but only covers a relatively small area.
Assign each keyword a score of 1 to 10. A highly confidential word or phrase, such as "salary increase" for the Human Resources department, should have a relatively high score.
A keyword list must satisfy your chosen criteria before Data Loss Prevention subjects it to a policy.
Aside from the product_short_name server, trend_client_program_plural can update from custom update sources.
Custom update sources help reduce trend_client_program_single update traffic directed to the product_short_name server and allow trend_client_program_plural that cannot connect to the product_short_name server to get timely updates.
Specify the custom update sources on the Customized Update Source List, which can accommodate up to 1024 update sources.
company_name recommends assigning some trend_client_program_plural as Update Agents and then adding them to the list.
Aside from the product_short_name server, Update Agents can update from custom update sources.
Custom update sources help reduce client_computer_single update traffic directed to the product_short_name server.
Ensure that the Update Agents update components, domain settings, and agent programs and hot fixes, only from the OfficeScan server option is disabled on the Update_Source_N_C screen (OSCE Client Update Source) in order for Update Agents to connect to the customized update sources.
If unable to update from all entries, the agent checks the following options under the OfficeScan agents update the following items from the OfficeScan server if all customized sources are unavailable or not found heading:
Components: If enabled, the agent updates from the product_short_name server.
Domain settings, programs and hot fixes can only be downloaded from the server or Update Agents.
In OSCE Client Tree, click Settings Privileges and Other Settings Other Settings Update Settings, the option Agents download updates from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate Server is enabled.
Domain settings: If enabled, the agent updates from the product_short_name server.
OfficeScan agent programs and hot fixes: If enabled, the agent updates from the product_short_name server.
The update process is different if the option Standard update source (update from OfficeScan server) is enabled and the product_short_name server notifies the agent to update components.
The agent updates directly from the product_short_name server and disregards the update source list.
In OSCE Client Tree, click Settings Privileges and Other Settings Other Settings Update Settings, the option OfficeScan agents download updates from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate Server is enabled.
Place the ActiveUpdate server at the top of the list only if you experience problems updating from the product_short_name server.
When trend_client_program_plural update directly from the ActiveUpdate server, significant bandwidth is consumed between the network and the Internet.
Customizing ptngrowth.ini for the Integrated Server
Open the ptngrowth.ini file in \PCCSRV\WSS\.
Modify the ptngrowth.ini file using the recommended values below:
Save the ptngrowth.ini file.
Restart the Trend Micro Smart Protection Server service.
Customizing ptngrowth.ini for the Standalone Server
Open the ptngrowth.ini file in /var/tmcss/conf/.
Restart the lighttpd service by typing the following command from the Command Line Interface (CLI):
service lighttpd restart
Encrypt supported channels using the specified key/password (only available if Endpoint Encryption is installed)
If Trend Micro Endpoint Encryption is installed alongside the OfficeScan agent, Data Loss Prevention can automatically encrypt files before allowing a user to pass them to another location.
If Endpoint Encryption is not installed, Data Loss Prevention performs the Block action on files.
Shared key: This key refers to the Group Key or Enterprise Key and the Endpoint Encryption administrator configures the type using PolicyServer MMC.
Encrypted files located on USB devices are subject to Data Loss Prevention scanning when users attempt to decrypt the files.
Decrypting files containing sensitive data on a USB device triggers the USB encryption protocol resulting in the system requiring that the sensitive data be encrypted (again).To prevent product_short_name from attempting to “re-encrypt” the data, move the encrypted files to a local drive before attempting to access the data.
Data Loss Prevention blocks attempts to upload files to cloud storage when using a web client.
Data Loss Prevention prompts the user before performing the Block action.
Data Loss Prevention supports encryption on removable storage devices when Endpoint Encryption is installed on the agent endpoint.
The .dat expression files generated by this Data Loss Prevention version are not compatible with previous versions.
The filetype file attribute files generated by this Data Loss Prevention version are not compatible with previous versions.
The filetype keyword list files generated by this Data Loss Prevention version are not compatible with previous versions.
To import DLP templates from OfficeScan 10.6, import the associated data identifiers (previously named Definitions) first.
Data Loss Prevention cannot import templates that are missing their associated data identifiers.
Damage Cleanup Services cleans computers of file-based and network viruses, and virus and worm remnants (Trojans, registry entries, and viral files).
The client_computer_single triggers Damage Cleanup Services before or after virus/malware scanning, depending on the scan type.
During Real-time Scan, the trend_client_program_single first performs virus/malware scanning and then triggers Damage Cleanup Services if cleanup is required.
Standard cleanup: The trend_client_program_single performs any of the following actions during standard cleanup:
For example, if the trend_client_program_single detects probable virus/malware during Real-time Scan and the action is quarantine, the trend_client_program_single first quarantines the infected file and then runs cleanup if necessary.
Open TSC.ini in .
Check TSCDebug.log in \debug.
Open TSC.ini and change the "DebugInfoLevel" value from 5 to 0.
Administrators cannot delete a data identifier that a DLP template is using.
Data Loss Prevention Exceptions
DLP exceptions apply to the entire policy, including all rules defined within the policy.
Data Loss Prevention applies the exception settings to all transmissions before scanning for digital assets.
If a transmission matches one of the exception rules, Data Loss Prevention immediately allows or scans the transmission depending on the exception type.
Data Loss Prevention Log Details
The Data Loss Prevention Log Details screen shows additional details about the digital asset transmission.
The details of a transmission vary based on the channel and process through which product_short_name detected the incident.
The following table includes “conref”s to the following rows in the __osce_conref_material.xml file: Date/Time, Violation ID, User Name, Computer, Domain, IP, Channel, Process, Source, Email Sender, Email Subject, Email Recipients, URL, FTP User, File Class, Rule/Template, Action
If the client_computer_single is unable to send logs, it retries after 5 minutes.
Data Loss Prevention Notifications for Administrators
Configure product_short_name to send administrators a notification when it detects the transmission of digital assets, or only when the transmission is blocked.
product_short_name comes with a set of default notification messages that inform administrators of digital asset transmissions.
product_short_name can send notifications through email, SNMP trap, and Windows NT Event logs.
Configure settings when product_short_name sends notifications through these channels.
Data Loss Prevention Notifications for client_computer_single_cap Users
product_short_name can display notification messages on client_computer_single computers immediately after it allows or blocks the transmission of digital assets.
To notify users that digital asset transmission was blocked or allowed, select the option Notify the agent user when creating a Data Loss Prevention policy.

product_short_name evaluates a file or data against a set of rules defined in DLP policies.
Policies determine files or data that requires protection from unauthorized transmission and the action that product_short_name performs after detecting a transmission.
product_short_name does not monitor data transmissions between the server and trend_client_program_plural.
product_short_name allows administrators to configure policies for internal and external trend_client_program_plural.
Data Loss Prevention Policy Configuration
You can start to create Data Loss Prevention policies after you have configured data identifiers and organized them in templates.
A DLP template combines DLP data identifiers and logical operators (And, Or, Except) to form condition statements.
Only files or data that satisfy a certain condition statement will be subject to a DLP policy.
For example, a file must be a Microsoft Word file (file attribute) AND must contain certain legal terms (keywords) AND must contain ID numbers (expressions) for it to be subject to the "Employment Contracts" policy.
You can create your own templates if you have configured DLP data identifiers.
It is not possible to delete a template that is being used in a DLP policy.
Obtain the logger.cfg file from your support provider.
Add the following data in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\TrendMicro\PC-cillinNTCorp\DlpLite:
Create a folder named Log in the C:\ directory.
Copy logger.cfg to the Log folder.
Deploy Data Loss Prevention and Device Control settings from the web console to start collecting logs.
Disable debug logging for the Data Protection module by deleting debugcfg in the registry key and restarting the computer_device.
Data Loss Prevention (DLP): Prevents unauthorized transmission of digital assets
product_short_name out-of-the-box has a Device Control feature that regulates access to commonly used devices such as USB storage devices.
Data Loss Prevention and Device Control are native product_short_name features but are licensed separately.
After you install the product_short_name server, these features are available but are not functional and cannot be deployed to client_computer_plural.
When the file has been incorporated into the product_short_name server, you can activate the Data Protection license to enable the full functionality of its features.
Installation and activation are performed from Plug-in Manager.
You do not need to install the Data Protection module if the standalone Trend Micro Data Loss Prevention software is already installed and running on endpoints.
View, activate, and renew the Data Protection license from Plug-in Manager.
Data Protection Widgets
The Data Protection widgets are available after activating OfficeScan Data Protection.
Available widgets:
Data Recorders (CD/DVD)
product_short_name monitors data recorded to a CD or DVD.
When product_short_name detects a "burn" command initiated on any of the supported devices or software and the action is Pass, data recording proceeds.
If the action is Block, product_short_name checks if any of the files to be recorded is or contains a data identifier.
If product_short_name detects at least one data identifier, all files—including those that are not, or do not contain, data identifiers—will not be recorded. product_short_name may also prevent the CD or DVD from ejecting.
product_short_name implements additional CD/DVD recording rules:
To reduce false positives, product_short_name does not monitor the following files:
Two file types used by Roxio data recorders (*.png and *.skn) are not monitored to increase performance.
product_short_name does not monitor files in the following directories:
..\Application Data
..\Local Settings
..\Program Files
ISO images created by the devices and software are not monitored.
During upgrades, the Setup program provides the option to back up the product_short_name database before upgrading to the latest version.
The backup package may require more than 300MB of free disk space.
SQL server
DataLossPreventionIncidentsOverTime Widget
Data Loss Prevention - Detections Over Time
This widget displays the overall number of Data Loss Prevention incidents for a specific time range.
The detections include all Data Loss Prevention incidents regardless of the action taken (Block or Pass).
The approved list for USB devices supports the use of the asterisk (*) wildcard.
Replace any field with the asterisk (*) to include all devices that satisfy the other fields.
For example, [vendor]-[model]-* places all USB devices from the specified vendor and the specified model type, regardless of serial ID, to the approved list.

Any file located directly under the C:\ drive, with or without file extensions
?? represents two characters and drive letters only have a single alphabetic character.
* represents multi-character data and drive letters only have a single alphabetic character.
Each program list on the user interface can contain up to 100 programs.
If you want to add more programs to a program list, you will need to add them to the ofcscan.ini file, which can accommodate up to 1,000 programs.
For instructions on adding programs to the ofcscan.ini file, see Adding Programs to the Device Control Lists Using ofcscan.ini.
Programs added to the ofcscan.ini file will be deployed to the root domain and will overwrite programs on individual domains and client_computer_plural.
Decompression Rules for DLP conref
To determine the files to scan, Data Loss Prevention subjects a compressed file to the following rules:
If the file is on the trend_client_program_single computer_device:
Open a command prompt and go to .
Run VSEncode.exe by double-clicking the file or by typing the following at a command prompt:
VSEncode.exe /u
This parameter opens a screen with a list of files found under \SUSPECT\Backup.
It might be possible for product_short_name to scan the file again and treat it as infected as soon as the file is restored.
If the file is on the product_short_name server or a custom quarantine directory:
If the file is on the product_short_name server computer, open a command prompt and go to \PCCSRV\Admin\Utility\VSEncrypt.
If the file is on a custom quarantine directory, navigate to \PCCSRV\Admin\Utility and copy the VSEncrypt folder to the computer_device where the custom quarantine directory is located.
For example, to restore files in C:\My Documents\Reports, type C:\My Documents\Reports\*.* in the text file.
Quarantined files on the product_short_name server computer are found under \PCCSRV\Virus.
Save the text file with an INI or TXT extension.
For example, save it as ForEncryption.ini on the C: drive.
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where the VSEncrypt folder is located.
Run VSEncode.exe by typing the following:
VSEncode.exe /d /i
is the path of the INI or TXT file you created (for example, C:\ForEncryption.ini).
On the trend_client_program_single computer_device, the debug log VSEncrypt.log is created in the .
For example, type VSEncode [/d] [/debug] to decrypt files in the Suspect folder and create a debug log.
When you decrypt or encrypt a file, product_short_name creates the decrypted or encrypted file in the same folder.
When selecting the computer_device to host the product_short_name server, consider the following:
The CPU load the computer_device handles
product_short_name comes with a set of default policies, which you can modify or delete.
Communication Ports for Trend Micro Control Manager
Allow all incoming and outgoing TCP/UDP traffic through ports 80 and 10319
Use when client_computer_plural have an MCP agent installation
ScanMail for Microsoft Exchange console
Allow all incoming and outgoing TCP traffic through port 16372
Use when client_computer_plural need to access the ScanMail console
InterScan Messaging Security Suite (IMSS) console
Use when client_computer_plural need to access the IMSS console
In this product_short_name version, the default scan method for fresh installations is smart scan.
This means that if you perform a fresh product_short_name server installation and do not change the scan method on the web console, all agents that the server manages use smart scan.
If you upgrade the product_short_name server from an earlier version and automatic agent upgrade is enabled, all agents managed by the server still use the scan method configured before the upgrade.
For example, if you upgrade from product_short_name 11.0, which supports smart scan and conventional scan, all upgraded agents that use smart scan continue to use smart scan and all agents using conventional scan continue to use conventional scan.
When defining permissions for domains, product_short_name automatically applies the permissions for a parent domain to all the subdomains that it manages.
For example, if the System Administrator has permission to view and configure all client_computer_plural that product_short_name manages (the OfficeScan Server domain), the permissions for the subdomains must allow the System Administrator access to these configuration features.
For example, to grant the user account Chris permissions to view and configure specific menu items for the subdomain Employees but only grant permission to view logs in the parent domain Managers, perform the following procedure.
Permissions for User Account Chris
Go to the User Accounts: Step 3 Define Agent Tree Menu screen.
Click the OfficeScan Server domain.
The OfficeScan Server domain is only configurable if you selected all of its subdomains on the User Accounts: Step 2 Agent Domain Control screen.
The Sales domain only displays if selected on the User Accounts: Step 2 Agent Domain Control screen.
Select the following menu items for Chris:
Chris can now view and configure the selected menu items for the Employees domain and can only view Logs for the Managers domain.
If Chris has permission to view and configure the Managers domain, product_short_name automatically grants the same permissions to the Employees subdomain as well.
Defining the Active Directory/IP Address Scope and Query
When querying for the first time, define the Active Directory/IP address scope, which includes Active Directory objects and IP addresses that the product_short_name server will query on demand or periodically.
To define an Active Directory scope, product_short_name must first be integrated with Active Directory.
On the Active Directory/IP Address Scope section, click Define Scope.
To define an Active Directory scope:
Go to the Active Directory Scope section.
Disabling this option causes product_short_name to query the database instead of each trend_client_program_single.
If querying for the first time, select an object with less than 1,000 accounts and then record how much time it took to complete the query.
To define an IP address scope:
Go to the IP Address Scope section.
Select Enable IP Address Scope.
Specify an IP address range.
Click the plus or minus button to add or delete IP address ranges.
For a pure IPv4 product_short_name server, type an IPv4 address range.
For a pure IPv6 product_short_name server, type an IPv6 prefix and length.
For a dual-stack product_short_name server, type an IPv4 address range and/or IPv6 prefix and length.
The IPv6 address range limit is 16 bits, which is similar to the limit for IPv4 address ranges.
The prefix length should therefore be between 112 and 128.
Prefix Lengths and Number of IPv6 Addresses
Number of IPv6 Addresses
Under Advanced Setting, specify ports used by product_short_name servers to communicate with agents.
Setup randomly generates the port number during product_short_name server installation.
To view the communication port used by the product_short_name server, go to OSCE Client Tree and select a domain.
The port displays next to the IP address column.
To check the endpoints connectivity using a particular port number, select Declare an endpoint unreachable by checking port .
When connection is not established, product_short_name immediately treats the éndpoint as unreachable.
The default port number is 135.
When connection to endpoints cannot be established, the product_short_name server no longer needs to perform all the other connection verification tasks before treating endpoints as unreachable.

Deployment of Data Protection to trend_client_program_plural_cap
Deploy the Data Protection module to trend_client_program_plural after activating its license.
After the deployment, trend_client_program_plural will start to use Data Loss Prevention and Device Control.
By default, the module is disabled on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2012 to prevent impacting the performance of the host machine.
You can enable or disable the module from the web console.
If the Trend Micro Data Loss Prevention software already exists on the endpoint, product_short_name will not replace it with the Data Protection module.
Offline and Independent agents install the module after reconnecting to the product_short_name server.
Users must restart their computers to finish installing Data Loss Prevention drivers.
For the server trusted port, search for the string "Master_DomainPort" and then check the value next to it.
For example, if the string appears as Master_DomainPort=80, this means that the trusted port on the server is port 80.
For the client_computer_single trusted port, search for the string "Client_LocalServer_Port" and then check the value next to it.
For example, if the string appears as Client_LocalServer_Port=41375, this means that the trusted port on the client_computer_single is port 41375.
A program path and name should have a maximum of 259 characters and must only contain alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9).
Use a question mark (?) to represent single-character data, such as a drive letter.

DLP About conref
About Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
Data Loss Prevention safeguards an organization’s sensitive data against accidental or deliberate leakage.
Data Loss Prevention allows you to:
DLP Actions conref
When Data Loss Prevention detects the transmission of data identifiers, it checks the DLP policy for the detected data identifiers and performs the action configured for the policy.
The following table lists the Data Loss Prevention actions.
Data Loss Prevention allows and logs the transmission.
Data Loss Prevention blocks and logs the transmission.
Data Loss Prevention displays a notification message to inform the user of the data transmission and whether it was passed or blocked.
Regardless of the primary action, Data Loss Prevention records the sensitive information to \DLPLite\Forensic.
Select this action to evaluate sensitive information that is being flagged by Data Loss Prevention.
DLP Channels
Users can transmit sensitive information through various channels. product_short_name can monitor the following channels:
Network channels: Sensitive information is transmitted using network protocols, such as HTTP and FTP.
DLP Custom Expression Import conref
Use this option if you have a properly-formatted .dat file containing the expressions.
Click Import and then locate the .dat file containing the expressions.
DLP Customized Expression Create conref
The name must not exceed expression_name_length bytes in length and cannot contain the following characters:
> < * ^ | & ? \ /
Type a description that does not exceed 256 bytes in length.
DLP Email Clients conref
product_short_name monitors email transmitted through various email client_computer_plural. product_short_name checks the email’s subject, body, and attachments for data identifiers.
If the email contains data identifiers, product_short_name will either allow or block the email.
Non-monitored email domains: product_short_name immediately allows the transmission of emails sent to non-monitored domains.
The only difference is that for non-monitored email domains, product_short_name does not log the transmission, whereas for monitored email subdomains, the transmission is always logged.
Monitored email subdomains: When product_short_name detects email transmitted to a monitored subdomain, it checks the action for the policy.
X400 format, such as /O=Trend/OU=USA, /O=Trend/OU=China
Email domains, such as example.com
For email messages sent through the SMTP protocol, product_short_name checks if the target SMTP server is on the following lists:
This means that if an email is sent to an SMTP server on the monitored targets list, the email is monitored.
If the SMTP server is not on the monitored targets list, product_short_name checks the other lists.
For emails sent through other protocols, product_short_name only checks the following lists:
DLP Expresssions Abt conref
For example, credit card numbers typically have 16 digits and appear in the format "nnnn-nnnn-nnnn-nnnn", making them suitable for expression-based detections.
DLP File Attribute List Create conref
Data Loss Prevention checks files with the specified extension but does not check their true file types.
Each extension must start with an asterisk (*), followed by a period (.), and then the extension.
For example, *.pol matches 12345.pol and test.pol.
Use a question mark (?) to represent a single character and an asterisk (*) to represent two or more characters.
- *.*m matches the following files: ABC.dem, ABC.prm, ABC.sdcm
- *.m*r matches the following files: ABC.mgdr, ABC.mtp2r, ABC.mdmr
- *.fm? matches the following files: ABC.fme, ABC.fml, ABC.fmp
For example: *.do* matches abc.doctor_john.jpg and abc.donor12.pdf.
Use semicolons (;) to separate file extensions.
DLP File Attribute List Import conref
Use this option if you have a properly-formatted filetype file containing the file attribute lists.
Click Import and then locate the filetype file containing the file attribute lists.
DLP Keyword List Create conref
Type a keyword that is 3 to 40 bytes in length and specify whether it is case-sensitive.
Use this option if you have a properly-formatted .csv file containing the keywords.
Click Import and then locate the .csv file containing the keywords.
Save the resulting .csv file to your preferred location.
DLP Keyword List Import conref
Use this option if you have a properly-formatted filetype file containing the keyword lists.
Click Import and then locate the filetype file containing the keyword lists.
DLP Network Channels conref
product_short_name can monitor data transmission through the following network channels:
HTTP and HTTPS
IM Applications
SMB protocol
To determine data transmissions to monitor, product_short_name checks the transmission scope, which you need to configure.
Depending on the scope that you selected, product_short_name will monitor all data transmissions or only transmissions outside the Local Area Network (LAN).
DLP Policy Create conref
Select Enable Data Loss Prevention.
If you are on the External Agents tab, you can apply all Data Loss Prevention settings to internal client_computer_plural by selecting Apply all settings to internal agents.
If you are on the Internal Agents tab, you can apply all Data Loss Prevention settings to external client_computer_plural by selecting Apply all settings to external agents.
A policy can contain a maximum of 40 rules.
DLP Removable Storage conref
product_short_name monitors data transmissions to or within removable storage devices.
When a file to be transmitted contains a data identifier, product_short_name either blocks or allows the transmission.
The Device Control action has a higher priority than the DLP action.
For example, If Device Control does not allow copying of files to a removable storage device, transmission of sensitive information does not proceed even if DLP allows it.
For example, a user who creates a file from Microsoft Word may want to save the file to an SD card (it does not matter which file type the user saves the file as).
If the file contains a data identifier that should not be transmitted, product_short_name prevents the file from being saved.
For file transmission within the device, product_short_name first backs up the file (if its size is 75MB or less) to %WINDIR%\system32\dgagent\temp before processing it. product_short_name removes the backup file if it allowed the file transmission.
If product_short_name blocked the transmission, it is possible that the file may have been deleted in the process.
In this case, product_short_name will copy the backup file to the folder containing the original file.
product_short_name allows you to define exceptions. product_short_name always allows data transmissions to or within these devices.
Identify devices by their vendors and optionally provide the device models and serial IDs.
DLP Rules Create conref
Data Loss Prevention processes rules and templates by priority.
If a rule is set to Pass, Data Loss Prevention processes the next rule in the list.
If a rule is set to Block or User Justification, Data Loss Prevention blocks or accepts the user action and does not process that rule/template further.
Each rule can contain a maximum of 200 templates.
The device model and serial ID are optional.
DLP System and App Channels conref
product_short_name can monitor the following system and application channels:
Data recorders (CD/DVD)
PGP Encryption
Synchronization software (ActiveSync)
Windows clipboard
DLP Template Create conref
Select multiple entries by pressing and holding the CTRL key and then selecting the data identifiers.
Each template can contain a maximum of 30 data identifiers.
To create a new keyword list, click Keywords and then click Add new keyword.
If you selected an expression, type the number of occurrences, which is the number of times an expression must occur before Data Loss Prevention subjects it to a policy.
DLP Template Import conref
Use this option if you have a properly-formatted .dat file containing the templates.
Click Import and then locate the filetype file containing the templates.
For details, see the OfficeScan Administrator’s Guide.
For details creating DLP rules, see .
The Data Loss Prevention Templates screen displays.
For instructions on adding templates in the Data Prevention Templates screen, see .
product_short_name uses the first-match rule when checking templates.
This means that if a file or data matches the definition on a template, product_short_name will no longer check the other templates.
Data Loss Prevention only supports the encryption of sensitive data on removable devices and cloud storage services.
Data Loss Prevention performs the Pass action without encryption on all channels where encryption is not supported.
When a DNS client_computer_single requests host name and address data from a DNS server, the process is called resolution.
Includes Antivirus, Damage Cleanup Services, and Web Reputation and Anti-spyware—all of which are activated during product_short_name server installation
product_short_name service
Services hosted through Microsoft Management Console (MMC).
For example, ofcservice.exe, the product_short_name Master Service.
For example, if a particular file is found under \PCCSRV on the server installation folder, the full path to the file is:
Any trend_client_program_single that has been configured to use smart scan
Any trend_client_program_single that has been configured to use conventional scan
To help you locate and interpret information easily, the product_name documentation uses the following conventions:
For example, C:\Program Files\ can be C:\Program Files\sample.jpg.
For example, File Save means, click File and then click Save on the interface
product_short_name provides the following methods to protect your environment from ransomware threats.
After the encryption process completes and product_short_name detects a ransomware threat, product_short_name prompts end users to restore the affected files without suffering any loss of data.
Automatic file backup requires at least 100 MB of disk space on the agent endpoint and only backs up files that are less than 10 MB in size.
If Automatically back up files changed by suspicious programs is not enabled, product_short_name cannot recover the first files affected by a ransomware threat.
Program inspection monitors processes and performs API hooking to determine if a program is behaving in an unexpected manner.
Not supported on Windows Server 2003 without SP2 (or later) and Windows XP 64-bit platforms.
Effectiveness of Vulnerability Scanner
Microsoft Active Directory
Specify the domain administrator account in Vulnerability Scanner to allow remote installation of the trend_client_program_single.
Vulnerability Scanner may have difficulty installing to computers using different administrative accounts and passwords.
Novell Directory Service
Vulnerability Scanner requires a Windows Domain account to install the trend_client_program_single.
The MAC address of the computer_device will remain the same, however, the DHCP server may assign a new IP address to the computer_device depending on availability.
Edge Relay Server System Requirements
Before installing the Edge Relay Server, ensure that the target server computer meets the minimum system requirements.
2 GHz dual core
4 GB
Windows Server 2012 R2
2 network cards
One for intranet connection to the product_short_name server
One for external connection to off-premises trend_client_program_plural
1 network card configured to use different ports for intranet and Internet connections
SQL Server 2008 R2 Express (or later)
SQL Server 2008 R2 (or later)
The OfficeScan Edge Relay Server setup program provides the option of installing SQL Server 2014 SP2 Express during installation.
Edge Relay Server
The product_short_name Edge Relay server provides administrators visibility and increased protection of endpoints that users take outside of the company's intranet.
By installing the Edge Relay server in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), off-premises trend_client_program_plural that cannot establish a functional connection to the product_short_name server can still perform the tasks in the following table.
The Edge Relay Server does not support IPv6 communication.
The Edge Relay server receives the updated Suspicious Object lists from the product_short_name server based on the configured schedule and distributes the lists to off-premises agents.
Off-premises agents send the object to the Edge Relay server.
The Edge Relay Server passes the object to the product_short_name server during the next configured synchronization.
The product_short_name server then passes the object to the Virtual Analyzer for analysis.
The Edge Relay server collects off-premises agent logs and periodically sends the log data to the product_short_name server based on the configured schedule.
Off-premises agents send status updates to the Edge Relay server, such as current pattern and component versions.
After configuring the Edge Relay server, trend_client_program_plural receive the settings and automatically report to the Edge Relay server once connection to the product_short_name server is unavailable.
Communication between the Edge Relay server, product_short_name server, and trend_client_program_plural is encrypted using certificate authentication.
The firewall exception template contains policy exceptions that you can configure to allow or block different kinds of network traffic based on the trend_client_program_single computer_device's port number(s) and IP address(es).
An example use of a restrictive policy exception is to block trend_client_program_single ports vulnerable to attack, such as ports that Trojans often use.
For example, you may want to permit trend_client_program_plural to access only the product_short_name server and a web server.
To do this, allow traffic from the trusted port (the port used to communicate with the product_short_name server) and the port the trend_client_program_single uses for HTTP communication.
trend_client_program_single listening port: OSCE Client Tree > Status.
Server listening port: OSCE Client Connection Settings.
product_short_name comes with a set of default firewall policy exceptions, which you can modify or delete.
137, 138, 139, 445
If you want a default exception to apply only to certain client_computer_plural, edit the exception and specify the IP addresses of the client_computer_plural.
The LDAP exception is not available if you upgrade from a previous product_short_name version.
When in assessment mode, product_short_name performs the following scan actions:
Administrators can configure product_short_name to defer the scanning of files. product_short_name allows the user to copy files and then scans the files after the copy process completes.
Deferred scanning requires that the Virus Scan Engine (VSAPI) be version 9.713 or later.
After scanning all third-party software drivers, the product_short_name agent reports the driver classification information to the system kernel.
Administrators can define actions based on the driver classifications in Group Policy in Windows and view scan results using Event Viewer on endpoints.
ELAM is supported only on Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, or later versions.
Web Reputation Services evaluates the potential security risk of all requested URLs at the time of each HTTP request.
The integrated Smart Protection Server installed with the product_short_name server provides Web Reputation Services.
Enabling Web Reputation Services (running under the process name LWCSService.exe) helps reduce the overall bandwidth consumption.
This is because product_short_name client_computer_plural obtain web reputation data from a local server, instead of connecting to the Smart Protection Network.

product_short_name includes a location awareness feature that identifies the client_computer_single computer’s location and determines whether the client_computer_single connects to the Smart Protection Network or Smart Protection Server.
product_short_name provides a location awareness feature that determines whether the trend_client_program_single’s location is internal or external.
Location awareness is leveraged in the following product_short_name features and services:
The trend_client_program_single’s location determines the web reputation policy that the trend_client_program_single will apply.
External trend_client_program_plural send scan queries to Smart Protection Network while internal client_computer_plural send the queries to the sources defined in the smart protection source list.
The trend_client_program_single’s location determines the Data Loss Prevention policy that the client_computer_single will apply.
For details about Data Loss Prevention policies, see .
Before the product_short_name server installation commences, Setup can scan the target endpoint for viruses and malware.

Endpoint Status Widget
This widget provides an overview of the connection and update status of trend_client_program_plural on your network, and the latest security compliance count of unmanaged endpoints that do not report to the product_short_name server.
Displays the last reported connection status of the trend_client_program_plural on your network
Displays a list of component categories and the count of trend_client_program_plural with an outdated component in each category
Displays a list of all endpoints that the product_short_name can detect, but that do not have the trend_client_program_single program installed or do not report to the product_short_name server
To ensure that the product_short_name server updates the unmanaged endpoint count regularly:
Define the Active Directory / IP address scope for an assessment.
Enforcement of trend_client_program_single_cap Updates
Security Compliance determines component inconsistencies between the product_short_name server and client_computer_plural.
For example, to monitor .ZIP files that users are transmitting, you defined a file attribute (.ZIP), added it to a template, used the template in a policy, and then set the action to Pass.
In this case, product_short_name will still subject the compressed file to the decompression rules to determine which of the files it contains should be scanned for digital assets and whether to transmit the entire compressed file.
When product_short_name encounters a compressed file:
If Rule 1 is not satisfied, product_short_name allows the transmission of the entire compressed file.
If Rule 1 is satisfied, the other two rules are checked. product_short_name allows the transmission of the entire compressed file if:
Optionally initiate Scan Now (manual scan) on trend_client_program_single endpoints after the update.
If the product_short_name server is unable to successfully send an update notification to agents after it downloads components, it automatically resends the notification after 15 minutes.
Exclude Microsoft Exchange Server Folders and Files from Scans
Microsoft Exchange Server scanning
If the trend_client_program_single and a Microsoft Exchange 2000/2003 server exist on the same computer_device, product_short_name will not scan the following Microsoft Exchange folders and files for virus/malware and spyware/grayware during Manual Scan, Real-time Scan, Scheduled Scan and Scan Now:
The following folders in \Exchsrvr\Mailroot\vsi 1: Queue, PickUp, and BadMail
.\Exchsrvr\mdbdata, including these files: priv1.stm, priv1.edb, pub1.stm, and pub1.edb
.\Exchsrvr\Storage Group
For Microsoft Exchange 2007 or later folders, you need to manually add the folders to the scan exclusion list.
Retains current list (default): product_short_name provides this option to prevent the accidental overwriting of the client_computer_single’s existing exclusion list.
After clicking Apply to All Agents, product_short_name displays a confirmation warning message.

External Proxy for trend_client_program_plural_cap
The product_short_name server and trend_client_program_single can use external proxy settings when connecting to servers hosted by company_name.
This topic discusses external proxy settings for client_computer_plural.
For external proxy settings for the server, see .
trend_client_program_plural use the proxy settings configured in Internet Explorer or Chrome to connect to the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network.
If proxy server authentication is required, client_computer_plural will use proxy server authentication credentials (user ID and password).
False Positive
In this case, the product_short_name administrator can create a policy that blocks the transmission of executable files that are 10 to 40MB in size to all departments except R&D.
Continuing the example in this topic, third-party software installers shared by other departments will most likely be blocked. company_name therefore recommends combining file attributes with other DLP data identifiers for a more targeted detection of sensitive files.
For a complete list of supported file types see the Data Protection Lists document at
Using Data Loss Prevention and File Encryption
product_short_name integrates with Trend Micro Endpoint Encryption to help you protect the sensitive information transferred to removable storage or cloud storage services.
After detecting sensitive information or an encrypted file, product_short_name displays the File Encryption screen with the following information:
If you do not provide a password before the countdown completes, product_short_name blocks the file transfer.
Decryption password prompt: When attempting to open a file previously encrypted with a fixed password, product_short_name prompts you to provide the decryption password.
Decrypting files containing sensitive data on a USB device triggers the USB encryption protocol resulting in the system requiring that the sensitive data be encrypted (again).
To prevent product_short_name from attempting to “re-encrypt” the data, move the encrypted files to a local drive before attempting to access the data.
FileReputationThreatMap Widget
This widget displays the total number of security threat detections made by File Reputation Services.
Solution: product_short_name uses the Damage Cleanup Engine and Damage Cleanup Template to remove Trojans.
The product_short_name firewall uses policies and profiles to organize and customize methods for protecting networked computer_device_plural.
With Active Directory integration and role-based administration, each user role, depending on the permission, can create, configure, or delete policies and profiles for specific domains.
Consider uninstalling other software-based firewall applications on trend_client_program_plural before deploying and enabling the product_short_name firewall.
The following steps are necessary to successfully use the product_short_name firewall:
Exceptions allow trend_client_program_plural to deviate from a policy.
For example, block all traffic for a set of client_computer_plural in a policy, but create an exception that allows HTTP traffic so client_computer_plural can access a web server.
Create and assign profiles to trend_client_program_plural.
With Active Directory integration and role-based administration, each user role, depending on the permission, can create, configure, or delete policies for specific domains.

When product_short_name detects that an FTP client is attempting to upload files to an FTP server, it checks for the presence of data identifiers in the files.
Depending on the DLP policy, product_short_name will allow or block the upload.
When product_short_name blocks an upload, some FTP clients will try to re-upload the files.
In this case, product_short_name terminates the FTP client to prevent the re-upload.
Users do not receive a notification after the FTP client terminates.
Inform them of this situation when you roll out your DLP policies.
If a file to be uploaded will overwrite a file on the FTP server, the file on the FTP server may be deleted.
For a list of supported FTP clients, see the Data Protection Lists document at:

Getting Started with product_short_name
This chapter describes how to get started with product_name and initial configuration settings.
There are a number of ways global firewall settings get applied to trend_client_program_plural.
A setting can apply only to trend_client_program_plural with certain firewall privileges.
For example, the firewall log sending schedule only applies to trend_client_program_plural with the privilege to send logs to the server.
You can grant certain trend_client_program_plural the privilege to send firewall logs to the product_short_name server.
Enable the trend_client_program_single to update the Common Firewall Driver only after the trend_client_program_single computer_device restarts.
When you enable this option, trend_client_program_plural will send firewall log counts once every hour to the product_short_name server.
product_short_name uses log counts and the firewall violation outbreak criteria to determine the possibility of a firewall violation outbreak. product_short_name sends email notifications to product_short_name administrators in the event of an outbreak.
For example, on computer_device_plural with both the product_short_name server and trend_client_program_single installed, you can exclude the product_short_name server database from scanning.

Importing, Exporting, and Copying DLP Rules
Administrators can import previously defined rules (contained in a properly formatted .dat file) or export the list of configured DLP rules.
Copying a DLP rule allows an administrator to modify the contents of a previously defined rule to save time.
Import, Export, and Copy Functions for DLP Rules
Importing a rule list appends non-existing rules to the existing DLP rule list.
Data Loss Prevention skips rules that already exist in the target list.
Data Loss Prevention maintains all pre-configured settings for each rule, including the enabled or disabled status.
Exporting a rule list exports the entire list to a .dat file that administrators can then import and deploy to other domains or client_computer_plural.
Data Loss Prevention saves all rule settings based on the current configuration.
Data Loss Prevention does not export any exceptions configured for the policy, only the settings configured for each rule.
Inactive trend_client_program_plural_cap
When you use the trend_client_program_single uninstallation program to remove the trend_client_program_single program from computer_device_plural, the program automatically notifies the server.
When the server receives this notification, it removes the trend_client_program_single icon in the client_computer_single tree to show that the client_computer_single does not exist anymore.
However, if you use other methods to remove the trend_client_program_single, such as reformatting the computer_device hard drive or deleting the trend_client_program_single files manually, product_short_name will not be aware of the removal and it will display the trend_client_program_single as inactive.
If a user unloads or disables the trend_client_program_single for an extended period of time, the server also displays the trend_client_program_single as inactive.
To have the client_computer_single tree display active client_computer_plural only, configure product_short_name to automatically remove inactive client_computer_plural from the client_computer_single tree.

All of the trend_client_program_single installation methods can be used to install the trend_client_program_single on pure IPv6 or dual-stack client_computer_plural.
For some installation methods, there are special requirements to install the trend_client_program_single successfully.
It is not possible to migrate ServerProtect to the trend_client_program_single using the ServerProtect Normal Server Migration Tool because the tool does not support IPv6 addressing.
Installation Methods and IPv6 Support
Web install page and browser-based installation
The URL to the installation page includes the product_short_name server’s host name or its IP address.
If you are installing to a pure IPv6 client_computer_single, the server must be dual-stack or pure IPv6 and its host name or IPv6 address must be part of the URL.
For dual-stack client_computer_plural, the IPv6 address that displays in the installation status screen depends on the option selected in the Preferred IP Address section of OSCE Client Settings on the Network tab.
Remember that a pure IPv6 Update Agent can distribute updates only to pure IPv6 or dual-stack client_computer_plural.
Security Compliance, Vulnerability Scanner, and remote installation
A pure IPv6 server cannot install the trend_client_program_single on pure IPv4 endpoints.
Similarly, a pure IPv4 server cannot install the trend_client_program_single on pure IPv6 endpoints.
For remote upgrades, product_short_name uses the previous version’s settings
Disk imaging technology allows you to create an image of the trend_client_program_single using disk imaging software and make clones of it on other computers on the network.
Each trend_client_program_single installation needs a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) so that the server can identify client_computer_plural individually.
Use the product_short_name program called ImgSetup.exe to create a different GUID for each of the clones.

Login Script Setup automates the installation of the trend_client_program_single to unprotected endpoints when they log on to the network.
Login Script Setup adds a program called AutoPcc.exe to the server login script.
AutoPcc.exe installs the trend_client_program_single to unmanaged computer_device_plural and updates program files and components. computer_device_plural_cap must be part of the domain to be able to use AutoPcc through the login script.
Install trend_client_program_plural on computers within the network domains or install the trend_client_program_single to a target computer_device by using its IP address.
Before installing the trend_client_program_single, take note of the following:
Record the logon credentials for each computer_device. product_short_name will prompt you to specify the logon credentials during installation.
The trend_client_program_single will not be installed on the computer_device if:
The product_short_name server is installed on the computer_device.
The computer_device runs Windows XP Home, Windows Vista Home Basic, Windows Vista Home Premium, Windows 7 Starter, Windows 7 Home Basic, Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows 8 (basic versions), Windows 8.1 (basic versions), and Windows 10 Home.
If the target computer_device runs Windows Vista (Business, Enterprise, or Ultimate Edition) Windows 7 (Professional, Enterprise, or Ultimate Edition), Windows 8 (Pro, Enterprise), Windows 8.1 (Pro, Enterprise), Windows 10 (Pro, Education, Enterprise), or Windows Server 2012 (Standard), perform the following steps on the computer_device:
Disable the Windows firewall.
Click Start ProgramsAdministrative Tools Windows Firewall with Advanced Security.
Open Microsoft Management Console (click StartRun and type services.msc) and start the Remote Registry service.
If there are company_name or third-party endpoint security programs installed on the computer_device, check if product_short_name can automatically uninstall the software and replace it with the trend_client_program_single.
For a list of client_computer_single security software that product_short_name automatically uninstalls, open the following files in \PCCSRV\Admin.
When enabling web reputation policies in a separate installation screen (for details, see ), client_computer_plural cannot send web reputation queries because product_short_name assumes that no Smart Protection Server installation occurred.
If a standalone server is available after installing product_short_name, perform the following tasks from the product_short_name web console:
When upgrading from product_short_name 10.x servers where the integrated server has been disabled, the integrated server is not installed. trend_client_program_plural retain their scan methods and the smart protection sources to which they send queries.
Integrated Server’s Approved/Blocked URL List Configuration
client_computer_plural_cap maintain their own approved/blocked URL list.
Any URL in the client_computer_single’s list will automatically be allowed or blocked.
The integrated server has its own approved/blocked URL list.
If a URL is not in the client_computer_single’s list, the client_computer_single sends a web reputation query to the integrated server (if the integrated server has been assigned as a smart protection source).
If the URL is found in the integrated server’s approved/blocked URL list, the integrated server notifies the client_computer_single to allow or block the URL.
The blocked URL list has a higher priority than the Web Blocking List.
To add URLs to the integrated server’s approved/blocked list, import a list from a standalone Smart Protection Server.
It is not possible to add URLs manually.
If you installed the integrated server during product_short_name server installation:
If the integrated server and trend_client_program_single exist on the same server computer, consider disabling the product_short_name firewall.
The product_short_name firewall is intended for client_computer_single computer_device use and may affect performance when enabled on servers.
Install the integrated Smart Protection Server after completing the product_short_name installation by using the .
Configuring the integrated server’s Approved/Blocked URL List
The Trend Micro Integrated Smart Protection Tool helps administrators to install or uninstall an Integrated Smart Protection Server after the product_short_name server installation is completed.
The current product_short_name version does not permit administrators to install/remove an Integrated Smart Protection Server once the product_short_name server installation is complete.
This tool enhances the flexibility of installation features from previous versions of product_short_name.
Open a command prompt and go to the \PCCSRV\Admin\Utility\ISPSInstaller directory where ISPSInstaller.exe is located.
Run ISPSInstaller.exe using one of the following commands:
ISPSInstaller.exe /i
ISPSInstaller.exe /i /f:[port number] /s:[port number] /w:[port number]
You can only configure the ports when using an Apache web server.

Under Active Directory Domains, specify the Active Directory domain name.
Specify credentials that the product_short_name server will use when synchronizing data with the specified Active Directory domain.
Click the () button to add more domains.
Click the () button to delete domains.
As a security measure, product_short_name encrypts the domain credentials you specified before saving them to the database.
When product_short_name synchronizes data with any of the specified domains, it will use an encryption key to decrypt the domain credentials.
Type an encryption key that does not exceed 128 characters.
You can choose a popular file format, such as .txt.
If the file is removed or the file path changes, product_short_name will not be able to synchronize data with all of the specified domains.
Save and Synchronize: Save the settings and synchronize data with the Active Directory domains.

Because IntelliTrap identifies such files as security risks and may incorrectly block safe files, consider quarantining (not deleting or cleaning) files after enabling IntelliTrap.
IntelliTrap uses the following components:
IntelliTrap is a Trend Micro heuristic technology used to discover threats that use real-time compression paired with other malware characteristics like Packers.
This covers virus/malware, worms, trojans, backdoors and bots.
IntelliTrap is a real-time, rule-based, and pattern recognition scan engine technology that detects and removes known virus/malware in files compressed up to six layers deep using any of 16 popular compression types.
IntelliTrap uses the same scan engine as virus scanning.
As a result, the file handling and scanning rules for IntelliTrap are the same as administrator-defined rules for virus scanning.
Agents write bot and other malware detections to the IntelliTrap log.
You can export the contents of the IntelliTrap log for inclusion in reports.
IntelliTrap uses the following components when checking for bots and other malicious programs:
Internal Proxy for trend_client_program_plural_cap
trend_client_program_plural can use internal proxy settings to connect to the following servers on the network:

"The internet protocol (IP) provides for transmitting blocks of data called datagrams from sources to destinations, where sources and destinations are hosts identified by fixed length addresses."
IPV6 Support conref
IPV6 Support
If the server manages IPv4 and IPv6 client_computer_plural, it must have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and administrators must identify the server by its host name.
If administrators identify the server by its IPv4 address, IPv6 client_computer_plural cannot connect to the server.
The same issue occurs if pure IPv4 client_computer_plural connect to a server identified by its IPv6 address.
If the server manages only IPv6 client_computer_plural, the minimum requirement is an IPv6 address.
Server identification can be by its host name or IPv6 address.
When administrators identify the server by its host name, it is preferable to use its Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).
This is because in a pure IPv6 environment, a WINS server cannot translate a host name to its corresponding IPv6 address.
IPv6 Support for product_short_name Server and client_computer_plural_cap
IPv6 support for product_short_name started in version 10.6.
Earlier product_short_name versions do not support IPv6 addressing.
IPv6 support is automatically enabled after installing or upgrading the product_short_name server and trend_client_program_plural that satisfy the IPv6 requirements.
IPv6 Support for product_short_name Server Updates
A pure IPv6 product_short_name server cannot update directly from pure IPv4 update sources, such as:
Any pure IPv4 custom update source
Similarly, a pure IPv4 product_short_name server cannot update directly from pure IPv6 custom update sources.
A dual-stack proxy server that can convert IP addresses, such as DeleGate, is required to allow the server to connect to the update sources.
IPv6 Support for Smart Protection Sources
A pure IPv6 client_computer_single cannot send queries directly to pure IPv4 sources, such as:
Smart Protection Server 2.0 (integrated or standalone)
IPv6 support for Smart Protection Server starts in version 2.5.
Similarly, a pure IPv4 client_computer_single cannot send queries to pure IPv6 Smart Protection Servers.
A dual-stack proxy server that can convert IP addresses, such as DeleGate, is required to allow client_computer_plural to connect to the sources.
IPv6 Support for trend_client_program_single_cap Updates
A pure IPv6 client_computer_single cannot update directly from pure IPv4 update sources, such as:
A pure IPv4 product_short_name server
A pure IPv4 Update Agent
Similarly, a pure IPv4 client_computer_single cannot update directly from pure IPv6 update sources, such as a pure IPv6 product_short_name server or Update Agent.
A dual-stack proxy server that can convert IP addresses, such as DeleGate, is required to allow the client_computer_plural to connect to the update sources.
IPv6 Support for Update Agents
A pure IPv6 Update Agent cannot update directly from pure IPv4 update sources, such as:
Similarly, a pure IPv4 Update Agent cannot update directly from pure IPv6 update sources, such as a pure IPv6 product_short_name server.
A dual-stack proxy server that can convert IP addresses, such as DeleGate, is required to allow the Update Agent to connect to the update sources.
IPv6 Support in product_short_name
This appendix is required reading for users who plan to deploy product_short_name in an environment that supports IPv6 addressing.
This appendix contains information on the extent of IPv6 support in product_short_name.
company_name assumes that the reader is familiar with IPv6 concepts and the tasks involved in setting up a network that supports IPv6 addressing.
For fresh installations, select IIS server to enable IPv6 support.
When upgrading to this product_short_name version, the product_short_name server to be upgraded must already be using IIS.
If you installed Apache using the previous product_short_name server installation package, product_short_name automatically installs and configures the IIS Web Server during the upgrade process.
If you manually installed the Apache server, you must manually remove Apache before upgrading the product_short_name server.
The IPv6 requirements for the product_short_name server and agent upgrades are as follows:
The product_short_name server to be upgraded must be version 10.6 SP3 or 11.x.
The server must already be using an IIS web server.
Assign an IPv6 address to the server.
In addition, the server must be identified by its host name, preferably its fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
If the server is identified by its IPv6 address, all agents currently managed by the server lose connection with the server.
If the server is identified by its IPv4 address, it cannot deploy the agent to pure IPv6 endpoints.
Verify that the host machine's IPv6 or IPv4 address can be retrieved using, for example, the ping or nslookup command.
The IPv6 requirements for the product_short_name server fresh installation are as follows:
The server must use an IIS web server.
If the server will manage IPv4 and IPv6 agents, it must have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and must be identified by its host name.
If a server is identified by its IPv4 address, IPv6 agents cannot connect to the server.The same issue occurs if pure IPv4 agents connect to a server identified by its IPv6 address.
If the server will manage only IPv6 agents, the minimum requirement is an IPv6 address.
The server can be identified by its host name or IPv6 address.
When the server is identified by its host name, it is preferable to use its Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).
The FQDN can only be specified when performing a local installation of the server.
Verify that the host machine's IPv6 or IPv4 address can be retrieved using, for example, the "ping" or "nslookup" command.
If you are installing the product_short_name server to a pure IPv6 endpoint:
Set up a dual-stack proxy server that can convert between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (such as DeleGate).
Position the proxy server between the product_short_name server and the Internet to allow the server to successfully connect to Trend Micro hosted services, such as the ActiveUpdate server, the Online Registration website, and Smart Protection Network.
A pure IPv4 OfficeScan server
Pure IPv6 trend_client_program_plural cannot install plug-in solutions because none of the plug-in solutions support IPv6.
Isolated product_short_name Server Updates
If the product_short_name server belongs to a network that is isolated completely from all outside sources, you can keep the server’s components up-to-date by letting it update from an internal source that contains the latest components.
This topic explains the tasks that you need to perform to update an isolated product_short_name server.
Java is a general-purpose programming language developed by Sun Microsystems.
Java supports programming for the Internet in the form of platform-independent Java "applets".
When you use a Java-technology enabled browser to view a page that contains an applet, the applet transfers its code to your computer_device and the browser’s Java Virtual Machine executes the applet.

product_short_name can accommodate a variety of network environments.
For example, you can position a firewall between the product_short_name server and its agents, or position both the server and all agents behind a single network firewall.
For information on resolving potential problems when managing trend_client_program_plural on a network that uses Network Address Translation, see the Administrator's Guide.
Due to security concerns, company_name recommends installing the product_short_name server within the company intranet.
If you need to manage endpoints that leave the local intranet, company_name recommends installing the OfficeScan Edge Relay Server in the DMZ.
To keep the size of logs from occupying too much space on the hard disk, manually delete logs or configure a log deletion schedule from the web console.
product_short_name keeps comprehensive logs about security risk detections, events, and updates.
Use these logs to assess your organization's protection policies and to identify trend_client_program_plural at a higher risk of infection or attack.
product_short_name also uses a central time verification mechanism to ensure time consistency between product_short_name server and client_computer_plural.
product_short_name performs time verification for all logs except for Server Update and System Event logs.
The product_short_name server receives the following logs from trend_client_program_plural:
The product_short_name server generates the following logs:
The following logs are also available on the product_short_name server and trend_client_program_plural:

To remove a blocked or approved program from the list, click the trash bin icon () next to the program.
product_short_name accepts a maximum of 1024 approved programs and 1024 blocked programs.
When a program is blocked and notifications are enabled, product_short_name displays a notification on the trend_client_program_single computer_device.
The management widget displays the connection status of trend_client_program_plural with the product_short_name server.
Managing Edge Relay Server Certificates
product_short_name provides a command line tool that allows you to create or renew the Edge Relay Server certificate that agents use for communication.
After creating a new certificate, the Edge Relay Server sends the new certificate to the product_short_name server which then deploys the certificate to agents the next time agents connect to the product_short_name server.
Off-premises trend_client_program_plural must connect to the product_short_name server to obtain the new Edge Relay Server certificate.
Any off-premises agents that do not receive the updated certificate can no longer communicate with the Edge Relay Server until connection with the product_short_name server is established.
On the Edge Relay Server, open a command line editor and go to the following directory:
C:\Program Files\Trend Micro\OfficeScan Edge\OfcEdgeSvc\web\service
OfcEdgeCfg.exe --renewcert -certpwd
-certpwd : Specifies the password for the certificate package
The Edge Relay Server creates the new certificate package and automatically sends the certificate to the product_short_name server.
The product_short_name server deploys the new certificate to trend_client_program_plural the next time the trend_client_program_plural report to the product_short_name server.

Manually Updating the product_short_name Server
Manually update the components on the product_short_name server after installing or upgrading the server and whenever there is an outbreak.
Go to OSCE Manual Server Update.
Trend Micro Management Communication Protocol (MCP) is company_name's next generation agent for managed products.
MCP replaces Trend Micro Management Infrastructure (TMI) as the way control_manager_prod communicates with product_short_name.
MCP has several new features:
NAT and firewall traversal support
HTTPS support
Single sign-on (SSO) support
There are two configurable types of menu items for product_short_name user roles.
Only users using the built-in administrator account can access User Accounts and User Roles.
When Vulnerability Scanner is able to "ping" host machines, it can retrieve additional information about the host machines.
Microsoft Exchange Server
When installing the trend_client_program_single during server installation, product_short_name needs access to all files that the agent scans.
Since Microsoft Exchange Server queues messages in local directories, it is necessary to exclude these directories from scanning which allows the Exchange Server to process email messages.
product_short_name automatically excludes all Microsoft Exchange 2000/2003 directories from scanning.
Configure this setting on the web console (OSCE Global Antivirus Settings > Scan Settings on the Security Settings tab).
For Microsoft Exchange 2007 scan exclusion details, refer to:
Microsoft Lockdown Tools and URLScan
When using the Microsoft IIS Lockdown Tool or URLScan, lockdown of the following product_short_name files may block trend_client_program_single and server communication:
Configuration (.ini) files
Data (.dat) files
Dynamic link library (.dll) files
Executable (.exe) files
When you install the trend_client_program_single, the installation program checks for any company_name or third-party endpoint security software installed on the target computer_device.
The installation program can automatically uninstall the software and replace it with the trend_client_program_single.
For a list of endpoint security software that product_short_name automatically uninstalls, open the following files in \PCCSRV\Admin.
from ServerProtect Normal Servers
The ServerProtect Normal Server Migration Tool is a tool that helps migrate computers running Trend Micro ServerProtect Normal Server to the trend_client_program_single.
The ServerProtect Normal Server Migration Tool shares the same hardware and software specification as the product_short_name server.
Run the tool on computers running Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008.
When uninstallation of the ServerProtect Normal server is successful, the tool installs the trend_client_program_single.
It also migrates the scan exclusion list settings (for all scan types) to the trend_client_program_single.
While installing the trend_client_program_single, the migration tool client_computer_single installer may sometimes time out and notify you that the installation was unsuccessful.
Verify the installation on the client_computer_single computer_device from the product_short_name web console.
The remote client_computer_single only has an IPv6 address.
The migration tool does not support IPv6 addressing.
The remote client_computer_single cannot use the NetBIOS protocol.
Ports 455, 337, and 339 are blocked.
The remote client_computer_single cannot use the RPC protocol.
The ServerProtect Normal Server Migration Tool does not uninstall the control_manager_trademarked agent for ServerProtect.
For instructions on how to uninstall the agent, refer to the ServerProtect and/or control_manager_prod documentation.
Migrating to the trend_client_program_single_cap
Replace client_computer_single security software installed on a target computer_device with the trend_client_program_single.

Administrators can change the location and deletion schedule of the forensic folder, and the maximum size of files that client_computer_plural upload by modifying product_short_name’s INI files.
Changing the location of the forensic folder after logging Data Loss Prevention incidents can cause a disconnect between the database data and the location of existing forensic files. company_name recommends manually migrating any existing forensic files to the new forensic folder after modifying the forensic folder location.
The following table outlines the server settings available in the \PCCSRV\Private\ofcserver.ini file located on the product_short_name server.
Forensic Folder Server Settings in PCCSRV\Private\ofcserver.ini
INI Setting
Administrators must enable the EnableUserDefinedUploadFolder setting before Data Loss Prevention applies this setting.
The user-defined forensic folder location must be a physical drive (internal or external) on the server machine. product_short_name does not support mapping a network drive location.
Administrators must enable the ForensicDataPurgeEnable setting before product_short_name applies this setting.
product_short_name only deletes data files that have passed the expiry date specified in the ForensicDataExpiredPeriodInDays setting.

Moving client_computer_plural_cap to Another OfficeScan Server
The product_short_name web console provides an option to move client_computer_plural managed by the server to another product_short_name server.
Record the following information for the other product_short_name server.
To view the server listening port, go to OSCE Client Connection Settings.
On the web console of the server to uninstall, go to .
On the client_computer_single tree, select the client_computer_plural to upgrade and then click Manage Agent Tree Move Agent.
Under Move selected agent(s) to another OfficeScan server, specify the server computer name/IP address and server listening port of the other product_short_name server.
If all client_computer_plural were moved and are already being managed by the other product_short_name server, it is safe to uninstall the product_short_name server.
This presents a clearer picture as to how best to deploy product_short_name.
Figure 1 illustrates a multiple site network topology.
Remote Site 1 WAN link averages around 70 percent utilization during business hours.
There are 35 agent endpoints on this site.
Remote Site 2 WAN link averages around 40 percent utilization during business hours.
Server 3 only functions as a file and print server for the group at Remote Site 1. This endpoint is a possible candidate for installing the product_short_name server, but may not be worth the extra management overhead.
All servers run Windows Server 2012. The network uses Active Directory, but mainly for network authentication.
All agent endpoints in Head Office, Remote Site 1, and Remote Site 2 run Windows Server 2012 or Windows 7.
Native plug_in_prog_parent_program Feature Management
Native plug_in_prog_parent_program features install with plug_in_prog_parent_program and administrators activate each feature from Plug-in Manager.
Manage some features, such as Trend Micro Virtual Desktop Support, from Plug-in Manager and others, such as plug_in_prog_parent_program Data Protection, from the plug_in_prog_parent_program web console.
Vulnerability Scanner reports whether all computers have antivirus software installed.
Because Vulnerability Scanner scans the network for antivirus installations, it is not feasible to have users scan their own computers.
The bigger the network, the more Vulnerability Scanner is needed for checking trend_client_program_single installations.
For small networks, Vulnerability Scanner can be an option to install the trend_client_program_single.
Other trend_client_program_single installation methods may prove much easier to implement.
Vulnerability Scanner allows you to scan an entire IP segment and install the trend_client_program_single easily on the LAN.
You need to run Vulnerability Scanner on each location and trend_client_program_single installation must be directed to a local product_short_name server.
product_short_name generates significant network traffic when it updates a component.
To reduce network traffic generated during component updates, product_short_name performs component duplication.
Instead of downloading an updated full pattern file, product_short_name only downloads the "incremental" patterns (smaller versions of the full pattern file) and merges them with the old pattern file after the download.
trend_client_program_plural updated regularly only download the incremental pattern.
LAN connection
512 Kbps
T1 connection and higher
It will take a long time to finish installing the trend_client_program_single.
When planning for deployment, consider the network traffic that product_short_name generates.

Administrators can enable this feature to start product_short_name agents before other third-party software drivers when endpoints start up.
This feature enables product_short_name agents to detect malware during the operating system boot process.
SQL Database Migration Tool
Administrators can choose to migrate the existing CodeBase server database to a SQL server database.
This version of product_short_name supports the upgraded Smart Protection Server 3.0.
The role-based administration enhancement streamlines how administrators configure roles and accounts making integration with company_name_tm_control_manager_prod_tm more streamlined.
Web server requirements
This version of product_short_name can integrate with the Apache 2.2.25 web server.
product_short_name server interface redesign
The product_short_name interface has been redesigned to provide an easier, more streamlined, and more modern experience.
All the features available in the previous OfficeScan server are still available in the updated version.
A slide show view of the Dashboard tabs allows you to view widget data without the need to manually control the console
If an Internet connection is unavailable, product_short_name automatically switches to the local online help system shipped with the product.
product_short_name supports the following operating systems:
Windows Server 2012 R2 (server and agent)
Windows 8.1 (agent only)
product_short_name supports the following browser:
Internet Explorer 11.0
product_short_name provides administrators the ability to restore previously detected “suspicious” files and add files to domain-level “approved” lists to prevent further actions on the files.
Administrators can use additional SHA1 verification checking to ensure that the files to be restored have not been modified in any way.
After restoring the files, product_short_name can automatically add the files to domain-level exclusion lists to exempt them from further scanning.
Browser Exploit Prevention uses sandbox technology to test the behavior of web pages in real time and detect any malicious script or program before the trend_client_program_single is exposed to threats.
product_short_name Data Protection has been enhanced to provide the following benefits:
Data Discovery through integration with control_manager_trademarked: Administrators can configure Data Loss Prevention policies on control_manager_prod to scan folders on trend_client_program_plural for sensitive files.
After discovering sensitive data within a file, control_manager_prod can log the location of the file or, through integration with Trend Micro Endpoint Encryption, automatically encrypt the file on the trend_client_program_single.
User Justification support: Administrators can allow users to provide reasons for transferring sensitive data or block the transmissions themselves. product_short_name logs all transfer attempts and the reasons provided by the user.
Smartphone and tablet support: Data Loss Prevention and Device Control can now monitor and take action on sensitive data being sent to smart devices, or block access to smart devices entirely.
Updated data identifier and template libraries: The Data Loss Prevention libraries have been updated with 2 new keyword lists and 93 new templates.
Device Control log integration with control_manager_trademarked
Command & Control (C&C) Contact Alert Services has been updated to include the following:
Global User-defined Approved and Blocked IP lists
Malware network fingerprinting to detect C&C callbacks
C&C server and client_computer_single logs record the process responsible for C&C callbacks
The self-protection features available in this release provide both light-weight and high level security solutions to protect both your server and trend_client_program_single programs.
Light-weight solution: Designed for server platforms to protect trend_client_program_single process and registry keys by default, without affecting the performance of the server
IPC command authentication
Real-Time Scan maintains a persistent scan cache which reloads each time the trend_client_program_single starts.
The trend_client_program_single tracks any changes to files or folders that occurred since the trend_client_program_single unloaded and removes these files from the cache.
This version of product_short_name includes global Approved lists for Windows system files, digitally signed files from reputable sources, and company_name-tested files.
After verifying that a file is known to be safe, product_short_name does not perform any action on the file.
Damage Cleanup Services enhancements provide improved detection capabilities for rootkit threats and a reduced number of false positives through updated GeneriClean scanning.
trend_client_program_single interface redesign
All the features available in the previous OfficeScan client program are still available in the updated version.
The updated interface also allows administrators to "unlock" administrative functions directly from the trend_client_program_single console in order to quickly troubleshoot issues without opening the web console.
Behavior Monitoring works in conjunction with Web Reputation Services and Real-time Scan to verify the prevalence of files downloaded through HTTP channels, email applications, or Microsoft Office macro scripts.
HTTP/HTTPS: Scans .exe files.
Email applications: Scans .exe, and compressed .exe files in unencrypted .zip and .rar files.
Administrators must enable Web Reputation Services on the agent to allow product_short_name to scan HTTP or HTTPS traffic before this prompt can display.
product_short_name matches the file names downloaded through email applications during the execution process.
For the subnet mask, Data Loss Prevention only supports a classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) type port.
That means that you can only type a number like 32 instead of 255.255.255.0.
For example, port 21 is typically for FTP traffic, port 80 for HTTP, and port 443 for HTTPS.
When product_short_name detects probable virus/malware during Real-time Scan and Scheduled Scan, it can display a notification message to inform the user about the detection.
When product_short_name detects spyware/grayware during Real-time Scan and Scheduled Scan, it can display a notification message to inform the user about the detection.
When product_short_name detects virus/malware during Real-time Scan and Scheduled Scan, it can display a notification message to inform the user about the detection.
Vulnerability Scanner can send the vulnerability scan results to product_short_name administrators.
If there are more keywords in the document than the number specified, Data Loss Prevention triggers a violation.

OfficeScan Troubleshooting Resources
This chapter describes resources you can use to troubleshoot possible issues with this version of product_short_name.
The OfficeScan widgets provide a quick reference for trend_client_program_single security statuses and detections, plug-in program information, and outbreak incidents.
OfficeScan XG Administrator's Guide
Managing the OfficeScan Server and Clients
Reports help you assess the security status of trend_client_program_plural managed by the product_short_name server.
If a threat-free file has not been modified for a certain period of time (the time period is configurable), the trend_client_program_single adds the cache of the file to the on-demand scan cache file.
For example, the number of caches may be less if the trend_client_program_single only scanned 200 of the 1,000 files in the computer_device during Manual Scan.
In a scan task where all caches are not expired, scanning that usually takes 12 minutes can be reduced to 1 minute.
Opening Port Communication through the Windows Firewall or a Third-party Firewall
On the Hyper-V server, ensure that the firewall allows communication through port 135 and test the Hyper-V connection again.
If the connection to the Hyper-V server is unsuccessful, configure WMI to use a fixed port.
For details on Setting Up a Fixed Port for WMI, refer to:
Open ports 135 and the newly created fixed port (24158) for communication through the firewall.
The trend_client_program_single can only be installed on the following operating systems that support IPv6 addressing:
Windows Vista (all editions)
Windows Server 2008 (all editions)
Windows 7 (all editions)
Windows 8/8.1 (all editions)
Windows 10 (Home, Pro, Education, and Enterprise editions)
About product_short_name
company_name_product_name_with_trademarks protects enterprise networks from malware, network viruses, web-based threats, spyware, and mixed threat attacks.
An integrated solution, product_short_name consists of the trend_client_program_single program that resides at the endpoint and a server program that manages all client_computer_plural.
The server, through the web-based management console, makes it easy to set coordinated security policies and deploy updates to every client_computer_single.
product_short_name is powered by the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network, a next generation cloud-client infrastructure that delivers security that is smarter than conventional approaches.
Security risk is the collective term for viruses/malware and spyware/grayware. product_short_name protects endpoints from security risks by scanning files and then performing a specific action for each security risk detected.
An overwhelming number of security risks detected over a short period of time signals an outbreak. product_short_name can help contain outbreaks by enforcing outbreak prevention policies and isolating infected endpoints until they are completely risk-free.

Mouseover on a particular product_short_name domain and click the add domain icon ().
(Optional) Select Duplicate Active Directory structure into OfficeScan agent tree.
This option duplicates the hierarchy of the selected Active Directory domains to the selected product_short_name domain.
Defining client_computer_single_cap Grouping Rules by IP Addresses
Create custom client_computer_single groups using network IP addresses to sort client_computer_plural in the product_short_name client_computer_single tree.
The feature can help administrators arrange the product_short_name client_computer_single tree structure before the client_computer_single registers to the product_short_name server.
Click Add and then select IP Address.
A single IPv4 or IPv6 address
An IPv4 address range
An IPv6 prefix and length
If a dual-stack client_computer_single’s IPv4 and IPv6 addresses belong to two separate client_computer_single groups, the client_computer_single will be grouped under the IPv6 group.
If IPv6 is disabled on the client_computer_single’s host machine, the client_computer_single will move to the IPv4 group.
Select the product_short_name domain to which the IP address or IP address ranges maps.
Click Manage Agent Tree Remove Domain/Agent.
If the domain has client_computer_plural and you click Remove Domain/Agent, the product_short_name server will re-create the domain and group all client_computer_plural under that domain the next time client_computer_plural connect to the product_short_name server.
Deleting the client_computer_single from the client_computer_single tree does not remove the trend_client_program_single from the client_computer_single computer_device.

OSCE Features and Benefits conref
product_short_name provides the following features and benefits.
Configure OfficeScan to subscribe to the Suspicious Object lists from the Control Manager server.
Using the Control Manager console, you can create customized actions for objects detected by the Suspicious Object lists to provide custom defense against threats identified by endpoints protected by Trend Micro products specific to your environment.
You can configure OfficeScan agents to submit file objects that may contain previously unidentified threats to a Virtual Analyzer for further analysis.
After assessing the objects, Virtual Analyzer adds any objects found to contain unknown threats to the Virtual Analyzer Suspicious Objects lists and distributes the lists to other OfficeScan agents throughout the network.
Plug-in Manager and Plug-in Solutions
Plug-in Manager facilitates the installation, deployment, and management of plug-in solutions.
Native product_short_name features
A web-based management console gives administrators transparent access to all client_computer_plural and servers on the network.
The web console coordinates automatic deployment of security policies, pattern files, and software updates on every client_computer_single and server.
And with Outbreak Prevention Services, it shuts down infection vectors and rapidly deploys attack-specific security policies to prevent or contain outbreaks before pattern files are available. product_short_name also performs real-time monitoring, provides event notification, and delivers comprehensive reporting.
product_short_name protects computers from security risks by scanning files and then performing a specific action for each security risk detected.
To contain outbreaks, product_short_name enforces outbreak prevention policies and isolates infected computers until they are completely risk-free.
product_short_name uses smart scan to make the scanning process more efficient.
Damage Cleanup Services cleans computers of file-based and network viruses, and virus and worm remnants (Trojans, registry entries, viral files) through a fully-automated process.
However, product_short_name may sometimes notify the user to restart their computer_device to complete the process of removing a Trojan.
Verify the credibility of websites and pages by integrating product_short_name with the Smart Protection Server or the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network.
product_short_name Firewall
The product_short_name firewall protects client_computer_plural and servers on the network using stateful inspections and high performance network virus scans.
Create rules to filter connections by application, IP address, port number, or protocol, and then apply the rules to different groups of users.
Data Loss Prevention safeguards an organization’s digital assets against accidental or deliberate leakage.
Data Loss Prevention allows administrators to:
Firewall logs available on the server are sent by trend_client_program_plural with the privilege to send firewall logs.
Grant specific client_computer_plural this privilege to monitor and analyze traffic on the computer_device_plural that the product_short_name firewall is blocking.
OSCE firewall_settings_osce_agent
OSCE gls_hotfix_osce_agent

The product_short_name Server
The product_short_name server is the central repository for all client_computer_single configurations, security risk logs, and updates.
Installs, monitors, and manages trend_client_program_plural
The product_short_name server downloads components from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server and then distributes them to client_computer_plural.
How the product_short_name server works
The product_short_name server is capable of providing real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and trend_client_program_plural.
Manage the client_computer_plural from a browser-based web console, which administrators can access from virtually anywhere on the network.
The server communicates with the client_computer_single (and the client_computer_single with the server) through Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
Protect Windows computers from security risks by installing the trend_client_program_single on each computer_device.
Configure client_computer_plural to report to another server by using the Agent Mover tool.

Therefore, to protect the product_short_name server computer_device against security risks, it needs to also have the trend_client_program_single program.
Choosing to install the trend_client_program_single during server installation is a convenient way to ensure that the server is automatically protected.
It also removes the additional task of installing the trend_client_program_single after server installation.
Install the trend_client_program_single to other computer_device_plural on the network after server installation.
See the Administrator’s Guide for the trend_client_program_single installation methods.
If a company_name or third-party endpoint security software is currently installed on the server computer, product_short_name may not be able to automatically uninstall the software and replace it with the trend_client_program_single.

Define DLP policies by configuring the following settings and deploying the settings to selected client_computer_plural:
Settings that Define a DLP Policy
A DLP rule can consist of multiple templates, channels, and actions.
Each rule is a subset of the encompassing DLP policy.
A DLP template combines data identifiers and logical operators (And, Or, Except) to form condition statements.
Only files or data that satisfy a certain condition statement are subject to a DLP rule.
Data Loss Prevention comes with a set of predefined templates and allows administrators to create customized templates.
A DLP rule can contain one or several templates.
Data Loss Prevention uses the first-match rule when checking templates.
This means that if a file or data matches the data identifiers in a template, Data Loss Prevention no longer checks the other templates.
Data Loss Prevention supports popular transmission channels, such as email, removable storage devices, and instant messaging applications.
Data Loss Prevention performs one or several actions when it detects an attempt to transmit sensitive information through any of the channels.
Exceptions act as overrides to the configured DLP rules.
Data Loss Prevention uses data identifiers to identify sensitive information.
Data identifiers include expressions, file attributes, and keywords which act as the building blocks for DLP templates.
Perform the following tasks after the product_short_name server installation completes.
The minimum postpone duration/elapsed time users can specify is 15 minutes.
The maximum is 12 hours and 45 minutes.
Postpone Scheduled Scan for up to __ Hours and __ Minutes
The maximum postpone duration/elapsed time users can specify is 12 hours and 45 minutes, which you can reduce by specifying the number of hour(s) and/or minute(s) in the fields provided.
Right-click the trend_client_program_single icon on the system tray and select Advanced Schedule Scan Setting.
Postpone scanning for __ hours and __ minutes.
The next Scheduled Scan runs on at .

Trend Micro Predictive Machine Learning uses advanced machine learning technology to correlate threat information and perform in-depth file analysis to detect emerging unknown security risks through digital DNA fingerprinting, API mapping, and other file features.
Predictive Machine Learning also performs a behavioral analysis on unknown or low-prevalence processes to determine if an emerging or unknown threat is attempting to infect your network.
After detecting an unknown or low-prevalence file, product_short_name scans the file using the Advanced Threat Scan Engine (ATSE) to extract file features and sends the report to the Predictive Machine Learning engine, hosted on the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network.
Depending on how you configure Predictive Machine Learning, product_short_name can attempt to Quarantine the affected file to prevent the threat from continuing to spread across your network.
After detecting an unknown or low-prevalence process, product_short_name monitors the process using the Contextual Intelligence Engine, and sends the sends the behavioral report to the Predictive Machine Learning engine.
Through use of behavioral malware modeling, Predictive Machine Learning compares the process behavior to the model, assigns a probability score, and determines the probable malware type the process is executing.
Depending on how you configure Predictive Machine Learning, product_short_name can Terminate the affected process and attempt to clean the file that executed the process.
Welcome to the company_name_trademarked product_name_trademarked Installation and Upgrade Guide.
This document discusses requirements and procedures for installing the product_short_name server, and upgrading the server and client_computer_plural.
This document discusses getting started information, client_computer_single installation procedures, and product_short_name server and client_computer_single management.
Identify the endpoint on which to install the product_short_name server.
Login Script Setup works well if there is no WAN in place because local traffic does not matter.
However, given that more than 50MB of data transmits to each endpoint, this option is not viable.
Remote installation from the web console
This method is valid for all the LAN-connected endpoints at the head office.
Because these endpoints all run Windows Server 2012, it is simple to deploy the package to the endpoints.
Due to the low link speed between the two remote sites, this deployment method may impact available bandwidth if product_short_name deployment occurs during business hours.
Use the whole link capacity to deploy product_short_name during non-business hours when most people are no longer at work.
However, if users turn off their endpoints, product_short_name deployment to these endpoints is not successful.
trend_client_program_single_cap package deployment seems to be the best option for remote site deployment.
However, at Remote Site 2, there is no local server to facilitate this option properly.
Create a response file by running Setup and recording the installation settings to an .iss file.
For fresh installations, create a response file from any computer_device without the product_short_name server installed.
Preventing URLScan Interference in client_computer_single_cap-Server Communication
Stop the World Wide Web Publishing service on the product_name server computer.
Modify the URLScan configuration file to allow the file types specified above.
Restart the World Wide Web Publishing service.
product_short_name monitors printer operations initiated from various applications.
product_short_name does not block printer operations on new files that have not been saved because printing information has only been stored in the memory at this point.

Vulnerability Scanner can check for the presence of security software on client_computer_plural.
The following table discusses how Vulnerability Scanner checks security products:
Security Products Checked by Vulnerability Scanner
Vulnerability Scanner uses RPC endpoint to check if SPNTSVC.exe is running.
Vulnerability Scanner cannot detect the ServerProtect Information Server or the ServerProtect Management Console.
If the target computer_device does not run Windows, Vulnerability Scanner checks if it has ServerProtect for Linux installed by trying to connect to port 14942.
Vulnerability Scanner uses the trend_client_program_single port to check if the trend_client_program_single is installed.
It also checks if the TmListen.exe process is running.
If you launched Vulnerability Scanner on any computer_device other than the product_short_name server, check and then use the other computer_device's communication port.
Vulnerability Scanner loads the web page to check for product installation.
Vulnerability Scanner loads the web page to check for ScanMail installation.
By default, ScanMail uses port 16372. If ScanMail uses a different port number, specify the port number.
Otherwise, Vulnerability Scanner cannot detect ScanMail.
InterScan family
Vulnerability Scanner loads each web page for different products to check for product installation.
InterScan Messaging Security Suite 5.x:
InterScan eManager 3.x:
InterScan VirusWall™ 3.x:
Trend Micro Internet Security (PC-cillin)
Vulnerability Scanner uses port 40116 to check if Trend Micro Internet Security is installed.
McAfee VirusScan ePolicy Orchestrator
Vulnerability Scanner sends a special token to TCP port 8081, the default port of ePolicy Orchestrator for providing connection between the server and client_computer_single.
The computer_device with this antivirus product replies using a special token type.
Vulnerability Scanner cannot detect the standalone McAfee VirusScan.
Norton Antivirus Corporate Edition
Vulnerability Scanner sends a special token to UDP port 2967, the default port of Norton Antivirus Corporate Edition RTVScan.
Since Norton Antivirus Corporate Edition communicates by UDP, the accuracy rate is not guaranteed.
Furthermore, network traffic may influence UDP waiting time.
Vulnerability Scanner detects products and computers using the following protocols:
RPC: Detects ServerProtect for NT
UDP: Detects Norton AntiVirus Corporate Edition clients
TCP: Detects McAfee VirusScan ePolicy Orchestrator
ICMP: Detects computers by sending ICMP packets
HTTP: Detects trend_client_program_plural
DHCP: If it detects a DHCP request, Vulnerability Scanner checks if antivirus software has already been installed on the requesting computer_device.

product_short_name Server and trend_client_program_single_cap Update
OfficeScan update
The product_short_name server downloads most of the components that client_computer_plural need.
If the product_short_name server manages a large number of client_computer_plural, updating may utilize a significant amount of server computer resources, affecting the server’s stability and performance.
To address this issue, product_short_name has an Update Agent feature that allows certain client_computer_plural to share the task of distributing updates to other client_computer_plural.
The following table describes the different component update options for the product_short_name server and client_computer_plural, and recommendations on when to use them:
ActiveUpdate server Server_ui Client_ui
The product_short_name server receives updated components from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server (or other update source) and initiates component update on client_computer_plural.
Use this method if there are no low-bandwidth sections between the product_short_name server and client_computer_plural.
ActiveUpdate server Server_uiUpdate AgentsClient_ui
The product_short_name server receives updated components from the ActiveUpdate server (or other update source) and initiates component update on client_computer_plural. client_computer_plural_cap acting as Update Agents then notify client_computer_plural to update components.
If there are low-bandwidth sections between the product_short_name server and client_computer_plural, use this method to balance the traffic load on the network.
ActiveUpdate server Update Agents Client_ui
Use this method only if you experience problems updating Update Agents from the product_short_name server or from other Update Agents.
Under most circumstances, Update Agents receive updates faster from the product_short_name server or from other Update Agents than from an external update source.
ActiveUpdate server Client
product_short_name client_computer_plural receive updated components directly from the ActiveUpdate server (or other update source).
Use this method only if you experience problems updating client_computer_plural from the product_short_name server or from Update Agents.
Under most circumstances, client_computer_plural receive updates faster from the product_short_name server or from Update Agents than from an external update source.
product_short_name Server Component Duplication
When the latest version of a full pattern file is available for download from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server, 14 "incremental patterns" also become available.
To reduce network traffic generated when downloading the latest pattern, product_short_name performs component duplication, a component update method where the product_short_name server or Update Agent downloads only incremental patterns.
product_short_name Server Logs
Aside from logs available on the web console, you can use other types of logs (such as debug logs) to troubleshoot product issues.
product_short_name Server Requirements
The IPv6 requirements for the product_short_name server are as follows:
The server must be installed on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2016.
If the server will manage IPv4 and IPv6 trend_client_program_plural, it must have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and must be identified by its host name.
If a server is identified by its IPv4 address, IPv6 trend_client_program_plural cannot connect to the server.
The same issue occurs if pure IPv4 agents connect to a server identified by its IPv6 address.
product_short_name Server Update Logs
Logs include component updates for the product_short_name server.
product_short_name Server Update Methods
Update product_short_name server components manually or by configuring an update schedule.
Scheduled server update: The product_short_name server connects to the update source during the scheduled day and time to obtain the latest components.
product_short_name Server Update Sources
Configure the product_short_name server to download components from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server or from another source.
You may specify another source if the product_short_name server is unable to reach the ActiveUpdate server directly.
After the server downloads any available updates, it can automatically notify client_computer_plural to update their components based on the settings you specified in OSCE Client Automatic Update.
If the component update is critical, let the server notify the client_computer_plural at once by going to OSCE Client Manual Update.
If you do not specify a deployment schedule or event-triggered update settings in OSCE Client Automatic Update, the server will download the updates but will not notify client_computer_plural to update.
product_short_name Server Updates
on the OfficeScan server
The product_short_name server downloads the following components and deploys them to agents:
Components Downloaded by the product_short_name Server
A pure IPv6 product_short_name server cannot distribute updates directly to pure IPv4 agents.
Similarly, a pure IPv4 product_short_name server cannot distribute updates directly to pure IPv6 agents.
A dual-stack proxy server that can convert IP addresses, such as DeleGate, is required to allow the product_short_name server to distribute update to the agents.
Since pattern file updates are available regularly, product_short_name uses a mechanism called component duplication that allows faster downloads of pattern files.
If you use a proxy server to connect to the Internet, use the correct proxy settings to download updates successfully.
On the web console's OSCE_Dashboard, add the ClientUpdates widget to view the current versions of components and determine the number of agents with updated and outdated components.
product_short_name Web Server/Agent Connection Settings
web server information
During product_short_name server installation, Setup automatically sets up a web server that enables networked computers to connect to the product_short_name server.
Configure the web server to which networked endpoint agents will connect.
If you modify the web server settings externally (for example, from the IIS management console), replicate the changes in product_short_name.
For example, if you change the IP address of the server for networked computers manually or if you assign a dynamic IP address to it, you need to reconfigure the server settings of product_short_name.
Changing the connection settings may result in the permanent loss of connection between the server and agents and require the re-deployment of trend_client_program_plural.
AutoPcc.exe updates the program files and the antivirus, anti-spyware, and Damage Cleanup Services components.
Protect Files in the trend_client_program_single_cap Installation Folder
All digitally-signed files with .exe, .dll, and .sys extensions
Protect trend_client_program_single_cap Processes
product_short_name blocks all attempts to terminate the processes in the following table.
Receives commands and notifications from the product_short_name server and facilitates communication from the trend_client_program_single to the server
Performs Real-time, Scheduled, and Manual Scan on trend_client_program_plural
This process is responsible for starting the trend_client_program_single console
product_short_name can also protect against the addition of processes in the Microsoft Software Restriction Policies (SRP).
Software Restriction Policies prevent the listed applications from running on the endpoint.
To prevent the addition of product_short_name processes in the Software Restriction Policies list:
Enable Protect OfficeScan agent processes.
To prevent other programs and even the user from modifying or deleting trend_client_program_single files, product_short_name provides several enhanced protection capabilities.
After enabling Protect files in the OfficeScan agent installation folder, product_short_name locks the following files in the root :
After enabling Protect files in the OfficeScan agent installation folder and Real-time Scan for virus/malware threats, product_short_name performs the following actions:
File integrity checking before launching .exe files in the installation folder
During ActiveUpdate updates, product_short_name verifies that the issuer of the file triggering the update is company_name.
If the issuer is not recognized as company_name and ActiveUpdate cannot replace the incorrect file, product_short_name logs the incident in the Windows event logs and blocks the update.
Prevents DLL hijacking
Some malware writers copy dynamic link library files to the trend_client_program_single installation folder or the Behavior Monitoring folder with the purpose of loading these files before the agent loads.
These files attempt to disrupt the protection offered by product_short_name.
To prevent the copying of hijacked files to the trend_client_program_single folders, product_short_name prevents the copying of files to the installation folder and Behavior Monitoring folder.
Prevents the locking of files using the SHARE:NONE setting in Windows
Protect trend_client_program_single_cap Registry Keys
product_short_name blocks all attempts to modify, delete, or add new entries under the following registry keys and subkeys:
Protect trend_client_program_single_cap Services
product_short_name blocks all attempts to terminate the following trend_client_program_single services:
OfficeScan NT Listener (TmListen.exe)
OfficeScan NT RealTime Scan (NTRtScan.exe)
OfficeScan NT Proxy Service (TmProxy.exe)
OfficeScan NT Firewall (TmPfw.exe)
OfficeScan Data Protection Service (dsagent.exe)

Proxy Configuration Privileges conref
Proxy Configuration Privileges for client_computer_plural_cap
proxy configuration privileges
You can grant client_computer_single users the privilege to configure proxy settings. trend_client_program_plural use user-configured proxy settings only on the following instances:
When trend_client_program_plural perform "Update Now".
When users disable, or the trend_client_program_single cannot detect, automatic proxy settings.
Incorrect user-configured proxy settings can cause update problems.
Exercise caution when allowing users to configure their own proxy settings.
Proxy for product_short_name Server Updates
Configure server programs hosted on the server computer to use proxy settings when downloading updates from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server.
Server programs include the product_short_name server and the integrated Smart Protection Server.
Proxy for trend_client_program_single_cap Component Updates
trend_client_program_plural can use proxy settings during automatic update or if they have the privilege to perform "Update Now".
Proxy Settings Used During trend_client_program_single_cap Component Updates
Proxy Settings Used
Automatic proxy settings.
Internal proxy settings.
trend_client_program_plural will first use automatic proxy settings to update components.
If automatic proxy settings are not enabled, internal proxy settings will be used.
If both are disabled, client_computer_plural will not use any proxy settings.
User-configured proxy settings.
You can grant client_computer_single users the privilege to configure proxy settings.
If automatic proxy settings are not enabled, user-configured proxy settings will be used.
If both are disabled, or if automatic proxy settings are disabled and client_computer_single users do not have the required privilege, client_computer_plural will not use any proxy when updating components.
Proxy Server screen
The product_short_name server uses the HTTP protocol for client_computer_single-server communication and to connect to the company_name ActiveUpdate server and download updates.
If a proxy server handles Internet traffic on the network, product_short_name needs the proxy settings to ensure that the server can download updates from the ActiveUpdate server.
Administrators can skip specifying proxy settings during installation and do so after installation from the product_short_name web console.
Proxy settings apply only when performing a remote fresh installation.
For remote upgrade, product_short_name uses the previous version’s settings.
When installing the product_short_name server on a pure IPv6 computer_device, set up a dual-stack proxy server that can convert between IP addresses.
This allows the server to connect to the ActiveUpdate server successfully.
Pure IPv6 Agent Limitations conref
Pure IPv6 trend_client_program_single_cap Limitations
The following table lists the limitations when the trend_client_program_single only has an IPv6 address.
Parent product_short_name server
Pure IPv6 trend_client_program_plural cannot be managed by a pure IPv4 product_short_name server.
A pure IPv6 trend_client_program_single cannot update from pure IPv4 update sources, such as:
Scan queries, web reputation queries, and Smart Feedback
A pure IPv6 trend_client_program_single cannot send queries to smart protection sources, such as:
Trend Micro Smart Protection Network (also for Smart Feedback)
Pure IPv6 trend_client_program_plural cannot connect to the Trend Micro-hosted Certified Safe Software Service.
Proxy connection
A pure IPv6 trend_client_program_single cannot connect through a pure IPv4 proxy server.
Most of these limitations can be overcome by setting up a dual-stack proxy server that can convert between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (such as DeleGate).
Position the proxy server between the trend_client_program_plural and the entities to which they connect.
The following table lists the limitations when the product_short_name server only has an IPv6 address.
A pure IPv6 server cannot:
Deploy trend_client_program_plural to pure IPv4 endpoints.
Manage pure IPv4 trend_client_program_plural.
A pure IPv6 server cannot update from pure IPv4 update sources, such as:
A pure IPv6 server cannot connect to the Trend Micro Online Registration Server to register the product, obtain the license, and activate/renew the license.
A pure IPv6 server cannot connect through a pure IPv4 proxy server.
A pure IPv6 server will have Plug-in Manager but will not be able to deploy any of the plug-in solutions to:
Pure IPv4 trend_client_program_plural or pure IPv4 hosts (because of the absence of a direct connection)
Pure IPv6 trend_client_program_plural or pure IPv6 hosts because none of the plug-in solutions support IPv6.
Position the proxy server between the product_short_name server and the entities to which it connects or the entities that it serves.
Accept the default quarantine directory, which is located on the product_short_name server computer.
The directory is in URL format and contains the server’s host name or IP address.
If the server is managing both IPv4 and IPv6 client_computer_plural, use the host name so that all client_computer_plural can send quarantined files to the server.
If the server only has or is identified by its IPv4 address, only pure IPv4 and dual-stack client_computer_plural can send quarantined files to the server.
If the server only has or is identified by its IPv6 address, only pure IPv6 and dual-stack client_computer_plural can send quarantined files to the server.
You can also specify an alternative quarantine directory by typing the location in URL, UNC path, or absolute file path format. client_computer_plural_cap should be able to connect to this alternative directory.
For example, the alternative directory should have an IPv6 address if it will receive quarantined files from dual-stack and pure IPv6 client_computer_plural. company_name recommends designating a dual-stack alternative directory, identifying the directory by its host name, and using UNC path when typing the directory.
Refer to the following table for guidance on when to use URL, UNC path, or absolute file path:
A directory on the product_short_name server computer
UNC path
\\\ ofcscan\Virus
A directory on another product_short_name server computer (if you have other product_short_name servers on the network)
If you specify an incorrect directory, the trend_client_program_single keeps the quarantined files on the SUSPECT folder until a correct quarantine directory is specified.
If you use UNC path, ensure that the quarantine directory folder is shared to the group "Everyone" and that you assign read and write permission to this group.
Whenever the trend_client_program_single detects a security risk and the scan action is quarantine, it encrypts the infected file and then moves it to the local quarantine folder located in \SUSPECT\Backup.
Specify the directory in OSCE AV Management > Settings {Scan Type} SettingsAction tab.
If the designated quarantine directory is on the product_short_name server computer, modify the server's quarantine directory settings from the web console.
The server stores quarantined files in \PCCSRV\Virus.
If the trend_client_program_single is unable to send the encrypted file to the product_short_name server for any reason, such as a network connection problem, the encrypted file remains in the trend_client_program_single quarantine folder.
The trend_client_program_single will attempt to resend the file when it connects to the product_short_name server.
After Behavior Monitoring matches all of the following criteria, product_short_name terminates and attempts to quarantine malicious programs:
product_short_name cannot recover the first files affected by the ransomware process.
To reduce the chance of product_short_name detecting a safe process as malicious, ensure that the agent has Internet access to perform additional verification processes using company_name servers.
This widget provides an overview of all the attempted ransomware attacks for a specified time range.

If product_short_name detects no security risk, the file remains in its location and users can proceed to access the file.
If product_short_name detects a security risk or a probable virus/malware, it displays a notification message, showing the name of the infected file and the specific security risk.
To modify the notification message, open the web console and go to OSCE Client User Notifications.
This procedure does not install product_short_name.
Download the OSCE.exe file and extract the contents.
Open a command prompt and type the directory of the product_short_name setup.exe file.
For example, "CD C:\OfficeScan Installer\setup.exe".
setup.exe -r
The -r parameter triggers Setup to launch and record the installation details to a response file.
After completing the steps, check the response file setup.iss in %windir%.
When client_computer_plural send scan queries to the integrated server, they identify the server by one of two File Reputation Services addresses - HTTP or HTTPS address.
Connection through the HTTPS address allows for a more secure connection while HTTP connection uses less bandwidth.
client_computer_plural_cap managed by another product_short_name server can also connect to this integrated server.
On the other product_short_name server’s web console, add the integrated server’s address to the Smart Protection Source list.
One of the ways the trend_client_program_single determines which policy or profile to use is by checking its connection status with the product_short_name server.
If an internal trend_client_program_single (or any client_computer_single within the corporate network) cannot connect to the server, the client_computer_single status becomes offline.
Any trend_client_program_single that loses connection with the product_short_name server will try connecting to reference servers.
Assign computers with server capabilities, such as a web server, SQL server, or FTP server, as reference servers.
You can specify a maximum of 320 reference servers.
The product_short_name server performs these tasks.
Register product_short_name using the Registration Key that came with the product and then obtain the Activation Codes.
Remind Users of the Scheduled Scan __ Minutes Before it Runs
product_short_name displays a notification message minutes before scanning runs to remind users of the scan schedule (date and time) and any Scheduled Scan privilege you grant them.
The notification message can be enabled/disabled from OSCE AV Management > Settings Privileges and Other SettingsOther Settings (tab)Scheduled Scan Settings.
Remote installation allows launching the installation on one computer_device and installing product_short_name on another computer_device.
Remote Registry service is managed from Microsoft Management Console (Click StartRun, and type services.msc).
Verify that the computer_device meets the product_short_name server system requirements.
Verify that the target endpoints meet the requirements for installing the product_short_name server.
For local upgrades, product_short_name preserves the original settings from the previous installation, including the server name, proxy server information, and port numbers.
Modify them after the upgrade from the product_short_name web console.
Remote Site 1 Deployment
Distributed File System (DFS)
Deployment to Remote Site 1 requires configuration of the Microsoft Distributed File System (DFS).
For more information about DFS, refer to
After configuring DFS, Server 3 at Remote Site 1 needs to enable DFS, replicating the existing DFS environment or creating a new one.
MSI package deployment
A suitable deployment method is the creation of the client_computer_single package in Microsoft Installer Package (MSI) format and the deployment of the client_computer_single package to the DFS.
Since the package will be replicated to Server 3 during the next scheduled update, client_computer_single package deployment has minimal bandwidth impact.
You can also deploy the client_computer_single package through Active Directory.
The key issue in Remote Site 2 is low bandwidth.
However, 60 percent of the bandwidth is free during business hours when approximately 154 Kbits of bandwidth is available.
The best way to install the trend_client_program_single is to use the same client_computer_single package in MSI format used in Remote Site 1. However, since there is no available server, you cannot use a Distributed File System (DFS).
Use another Active Directory policy, but again, not specifying the DFS share as the source.
These methods keep the installation traffic within the local network and minimizes the traffic across the WAN.
To minimize the impact of component updates across the WAN, designate one client_computer_single to act as an Update Agent.
Remote Upgrade Installations of OfficeScan
You must manually uninstall the Apache web server before attempting a remote upgrade of OfficeScan.
During a remote upgrade installation of the OfficeScan server, the following screens appear:

If you upgraded from a previous version of product_short_name, web browser and proxy server cache files may prevent the product_short_name web console from loading properly.
Clear the cache memory on the browser and on any proxy servers located between the product_short_name server and the endpoint you use to access the web console.
If settings for transmission scope, monitored targets, and non-monitored targets conflict, product_short_name recognizes the following priorities, in order of highest priority to lowest:
To prevent infected from being opened, product_short_name encrypts the file during the following instances:
product_short_name provides a tool that decrypts and then restores the file in case you need to retrieve information from it. product_short_name can decrypt and restore the following files:
Files that product_short_name can Decrypt and Restore
By default, this directory is located on the product_short_name server computer.
These are the backup of infected files that product_short_name was able to clean.
These files are found in the \Backup folder.
To restore these files, users need to move them to the \SUSPECT\Backup folder.
You can restore files that product_short_name quarantined if you believe that the detection was inaccurate.
The Central Quarantine Restore feature allows you to search for files in the quarantine directory and perform SHA1 verification checking to ensure that the files you want to restore have not been modified in any way.
Click Tasks Central Quarantine Restore.
Select Add restored file to the domain-level exclusion list to ensure that all trend_client_program_plural in the domain(s) where the files are restored add the file to the scan exclusion list.
This ensures that product_short_name does not detect the file as a threat during future scans.
Optionally type the SHA1 value of the file for verification purposes.
To view the individual trend_client_program_plural that restore the file, click the link in the Endpoints column.
To verify that product_short_name successfully restored the quarantined file, see .
product_short_name notifies you of the restoration status.
Stop the OfficeScan Master Service.
Overwrite the database files in \PCCSRV\HTTPDB with the backup files.
Restoring the Previous product_short_name Server Version
The restoration procedure for the product_short_name server requires that administrators uninstall the product_short_name product_version server, reinstall the older server version, manually stop Windows services, update the system registry, and replace product_short_name server files in the product_short_name installation directory.
Ensure that you roll back trend_client_program_plural before restoring the product_short_name server.
Uninstall the product_short_name product_version server.
Install the previous product_short_name server version.
company_name recommends not changing the host name or IP address when restoring the server.
To verify the previous version of the server, go to the and view the restoration folder created during the product_short_name product_version server installation.

Restricting Access to the trend_client_program_single_cap Console
Click the Other Settings tab and go to the OfficeScan Agent Access Restriction section.
Select Do not allow users to access the OfficeScan agent console from the system tray or Windows Start menu.
When Scheduled Scan did not launch because product_short_name is not running on the day and time of Scheduled Scan or if the user interrupts Scheduled Scan (for example, turns off the endpoint after the scan begins), you can specify when product_short_name resumes scanning.
Same time next day: If product_short_name is running at the exact same time the next day, scanning is resumed.
__ minutes after the endpoint starts: product_short_name resumes scanning a number of minutes after the user turns on the computer_device.
The number of minutes is between 10 and 120.
In the agent tree, click the root domain icon () or select specific domains or agents.
Run the Trend Micro Case Diagnostics Tool.
All files in the \PCCSRV\Private\AuthorStore folder.
Use Role-based Administration to grant and control access to the product_short_name web console.
If there are several product_short_name administrators in your organization, you can use this feature to assign specific web console privileges to the administrators and present them with only the tools and permissions necessary to perform specific tasks.
In addition, you can grant non-administrators "view only" access to the web console.
A role defines the level of access to the web console.
Users log on to the web console using custom user accounts or Active Directory accounts.
View web console activities for all users from the system event logs.
Administrators can speed up the rollback process by initiating a Manual Update on trend_client_program_plural.
To view this screen, go to OSCE Client Rollback.
If these components do not function properly, roll them back to their previous versions. product_short_name retains the current and the previous versions of the Virus Scan Engine, and the last five versions of the Virus Pattern and Smart Scan Agent Pattern.
product_short_name uses different scan engines for agents running 32-bit and 64-bit platforms.
Go to OSCE Client Rollback
Rolling Back the trend_client_program_plural_cap
product_short_name can only rollback trend_client_program_plural to the same version of the server being restored.
You cannot rollback trend_client_program_plural to an older version than the server.
Ensure that you roll back trend_client_program_plural before rolling back the product_short_name server.
Ensure that trend_client_program_plural cannot upgrade the agent program.
On the product_short_name product_version web console, go to OSCE Client Tree.
Select the trend_client_program_plural to be rolled back.
Enable the OfficeScan agents can update components but not upgrade the agent program or deploy hot fixes option.
On the product_short_name product_version web console, go to OSCE Client Update Source.
When the trend_client_program_single to be rolled back updates from the update source, the trend_client_program_single is uninstalled and the previous trend_client_program_single version is installed.
After the previous trend_client_program_single version is installed, inform the user to restart the endpoint.
After the rollback process is complete, the trend_client_program_single continues to report to the same product_short_name server.
After rolling back the trend_client_program_single, all components, including the Virus Pattern, also roll back to the previous version.
If administrators do not roll back the product_short_name server, the rolled-back trend_client_program_single cannot update components.
Administrators must change the update source of the rolled-back trend_client_program_single to the standard update source to receive further component updates.
Rolling Back the product_short_name Server and trend_client_program_plural_cap Using the Server Backup Package
The product_short_name rollback procedure involves rolling back trend_client_program_plural and then rolling back the product_short_name server.
Administrators can only roll back the product_short_name server and agents using the following procedure if the administrator chose to back up the server during the installation process.
If the server backup files are not available, refer to the previously installed OfficeScan version's Installation and Upgrade Guide for manual rollback procedures.
This version of product_short_name only supports rollbacks to the following product_short_name versions:
product_short_name 11.0 Service Pack 1 with a Critical Patch
product_short_name 11.0 Service Pack 1
product_short_name 11.0
Remote procedure call (RPC) is a network protocol that allows a program running on one host to cause code to be executed on another host.
Rule 1: Maximum Size of a Decompressed File
Example: You set the limit to 20MB.
Scenario 1: If the size of archive.zip upon decompression is 30MB, none of the files contained in archive.zip will be scanned.
Scenario 2: If the size of my_archive.zip upon decompression is 10MB:
If my_archive.zip does not contain compressed files, product_short_name skips Rule 2 and proceeds to Rule 3.
If my_archive.zip contains compressed files, the size of all decompressed files must be within the limit.
For example, if my_archive.zip contains AAA.rar, BBB.zip and EEE.zip, and EEE.zip contains 222.zip:
= 10MB upon decompression
my_archive.zip, BBB.zip, EEE.zip, and 222.zip will be checked against Rule 2 because the combined size of these files is within the 20MB limit.
AAA.rar is skipped.
Rule 2: Maximum Compression Layers
product_short_name will ignore 333.txt because it is located on the third layer.
product_short_name will flag the following files for scanning and then check Rule 3:
Rule 3: Maximum Number of Files to Scan
product_short_name scans files up to the specified limit. product_short_name scans files and folders in numeric and then alphabetic order.
Continuing from the example in Rule 2, product_short_name has flagged the highlighted files for scanning:
In addition, my_archive.zip contains a folder named 7Folder, which was not checked against Rule 2. This folder contains FFF.doc and GGG.ppt.
This brings the total number of files to be scanned to 5, as highlighted below:
If you set the limit to 4 files, the following files are scanned:
For files that contain embedded files, product_short_name extracts the content of the embedded files.
If the extracted content is text, the host file (such as 123.doc) and embedded files (such as abc.txt and xyz.xls) are counted as one.
If the extracted content is not text, the host file (such as 123.doc) and embedded files (such as abc.exe) are counted separately.
The trend_client_program_single receives updates automatically from the prod_server_name.
If you use a proxy server to connect to the Internet, ensure you have the correct proxy settings.
You can also run a manual update by right-clicking the trend_client_program_single icon in the Windows Task Bar and then selecting Update Now.
Running Agent Mover
On the product_short_name server, go to \PCCSRV\Admin\Utility\IpXfer.

In the Scheduled Scan Settings section, modify the Postpone Scheduled Scan for up to __ hour(s) and __ minute(s) setting.
Specify the action product_short_name performs when a particular scan type detects a security risk. product_short_name has a different set of scan actions for virus/malware and spyware/grayware.
No Scan Now or Scheduled Scan performed for the last (x) days: The trend_client_program_single is non-compliant if it did not run Scan Now or Scheduled Scan within the specified number of days.
Scan Now or Scheduled Scan exceeded (x) hours: The trend_client_program_single is non-compliant if the last Scan Now or Scheduled Scan lasted more than the specified number of hours.
For example, if the last Scheduled Scan lasted more than the specified number of hours, the client_computer_single is counted in the Scan Now or Scheduled Scan exceeded hours category.
product_short_name will not scan a file if its file extension matches any of the extensions included in this exclusion list.
You can specify a maximum of 256 file extensions.
A period (.) is not required before the extension.
For Manual Scan, Scheduled Scan, and Scan Now, use a question mark (?) or asterisk (*) as a wildcard character.
For example, if you do not want to scan all files with extensions starting with D, such as DOC, DOT, or DAT, type D* or D?.
Scan Exclusion List (Directories) conref
product_short_name will not scan all files found under a specific directory on the computer.
You can specify a maximum of 256 directories.
By excluding a directory from scans, product_short_name automatically excludes all of the directory’s sub-directories from scans.
If you select this option, product_short_name automatically excludes the directories of the following company_name products from scanning:
ScanMail for Microsoft Exchange (all versions except version 7).
If you use version 7, add the following folders to the exclusion list:
ScanMail eManager 3.11, 5.1, 5.11, 5.12
ScanMail for Lotus Notes eManager NT
InterScan Web Protect
InterScan FTP VirusWall
InterScan Web VirusWall
InterScan E-mail VirusWall
InterScan VirusWall 3.53
InterScan NSAPI Plug-in
InterScan eManager 3.5x
Scan Exclusions - Files conref
product_short_name will not scan a file if its file name matches any of the names included in this exclusion list.
If you want to exclude a file found under a specific location on the computer_device, include the file path, such as C:\Temp\sample.jpg.
You can specify a maximum of 256 files.
When a particular scan type runs, product_short_name checks the scan exclusion list to determine which files on the computer_device will be excluded from both virus/malware and spyware/grayware scanning.
When you enable scan exclusion, product_short_name will not scan a file under the following conditions:
Scan for Cookies
cookie scanning
Select this option if you consider cookies as potential security risks.
When selected, all client_computer_plural managed by the server will scan cookies for spyware/grayware during Manual Scan, Scheduled Scan, Real-time Scan, and Scan Now.
You can view the scan log by accessing the product_short_name server or trend_client_program_single consoles.
To view the Scan Operation logs on the product_short_name server, go to one of the following locations:
OSCE Client Security Risks Log and click View Logs Scan Operation Logs
OSCE AV Management and click Logs Scan Operation Logs
Date and time product_short_name started scanning
Date and time product_short_name stopped scanning
For example, the product_short_name Real-time Scan service might have terminated unexpectedly or the user performed a forced restart of the client_computer_single.
In this product_short_name version, you can configure client_computer_plural to use either Smart Scan or Conventional Scan.
In this product_short_name version, administrators can configure agents to use either Smart Scan or Conventional Scan.
When upgrading product_short_name from an earlier version, retain or customize the scan method for each domain depending on the upgrade method chosen.
When planning to upgrade the OfficeScan 10.x or 11.x server directly on the server computer, it is not necessary to make scan method changes from the web console because agents retain their scan method settings after they upgrade.
When planning to upgrade OfficeScan 10.x or 11.x agents by moving them to the product_short_name product_version server:
In the product_short_name product_version server, choose manual agent grouping.
Duplicate the domain structure and scan method settings in the OfficeScan 10.x or 11.x server into the product_short_name product_version server.
If the domain structure and scan method settings on the two servers are not identical, some agents that move to the product_short_name product_version server may not apply their original scan method settings.
During fresh installations, the default scan method for client_computer_plural is the Smart Scan method. product_short_name also allows you to customize the scan method for each domain after installing the server.
If you will use the package to upgrade the client_computer_single to this product_short_name version, check the domain level scan method on the web console.
On the console, go to OSCE Client Tree, select the client_computer_single tree domain to which the client_computer_single belongs, and click SettingsScan Settings Scan Methods.
If you will use the package to perform a fresh installation of the trend_client_program_single, check the client_computer_single grouping setting.
On the web console, go to OSCE Client Grouping.
If the client_computer_single grouping is by NetBIOS, Active Directory, or DNS domain, check the domain to which the target computer_device belongs.
If the domain does not exist, check the root level scan method (select the root domain icon () in the client_computer_single tree and click SettingsScan Settings Scan Methods).
If you will use the package to update components on the client_computer_single using this product_short_name version, check the scan method configured for the client_computer_single tree domain to which the client_computer_single belongs.
A conventional scan client_computer_single stores all product_short_name components on the client_computer_single computer_device and scans all files locally.
Available in this product_short_name version and all earlier product_short_name versions

Scan Methods
Scan Now is initiated remotely by product_short_name administrators through the web console and can be targeted to one or several client_computer_single computers.
Scan privileges allow users or the trend_client_program_single to perform the following tasks:
Users enable scanning of POP3 email messages for virus/malware.
You can configure product_short_name to skip scanning of trusted processes during Real-time and Behavior Monitoring scans.
After adding a program to the Trusted Programs List, product_short_name does not subject the program or any processes initiated by the program to Real-time Scan.
The file is not located in the Windows system directory.
After adding a program to the Trusted Programs List, product_short_name automatically excludes the program from the following scans:
Scan hidden folders: Allows product_short_name to detect and then scan hidden folders on the endpoint during Manual Scan
Scan network drive: Scans network drives or folders mapped to the trend_client_program_single endpoint during Manual Scan or Real-time Scan.
Scan the boot sector of the USB storage device after plugging in: Automatically scans only the boot sector of a USB storage device every time the user plugs it in (Real-time Scan).
Scan all files in removable storage devices after plugging in: Automatically scans all files on a USB storage device every time the user plugs it in (Real-time Scan).
Scan compressed files: Allows product_short_name to scan up to a specified number of compression layers and skip scanning any excess layers. product_short_name also cleans or deletes infected files within compressed files.
For example, if the maximum is two layers and a compressed file to be scanned has six layers, product_short_name scans two layers and skips the remaining four.
If a compressed file contains security threats, product_short_name cleans or deletes the file.
product_short_name treats Microsoft Office 2007 files in Office Open XML format as compressed files.
Office Open XML, the file format for Office 2007 applications, uses ZIP compression technologies.
Scan OLE objects: When a file contains multiple Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) layers, product_short_name scans the specified number of layers and ignores the remaining layers.
Each layer is scanned for virus/malware and spyware/grayware.
Detect exploit code in OLE files: OLE Exploit Detection heuristically identifies malware by checking Microsoft Office files for exploit code.
The specified number of layers is applicable to both Scan OLE objects and Detect exploit code options.
Enable IntelliTrap: Detects and removes virus/malware on compressed executable files.
Enable CVE exploit scanning for files downloaded through web and email channels: Blocks processes that attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in commercially available products based on the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system.
product_short_name provides several types of scans to protect computer_device_plural from security risks.
Modify the scan settings from the web console by going to and clicking Settings {Scan Type}.
product_short_name provides the following scan types to protect trend_client_program_single computers from security risks:
Advanced cleanup: In addition to the standard cleanup actions, the trend_client_program_single stops activities by rogue security software (also known as FakeAV) and certain rootkit variants.
The trend_client_program_single also uses advanced cleanup rules to proactively detect and stop applications that exhibit FakeAV and rootkit behavior.
To modify the notification message, select Virus/Malware from the Type drop-down in OSCE Client User Notifications.
If the action for an infected file is "Quarantine", the trend_client_program_single encrypts the file and moves it to a temporary quarantine folder located in \SUSPECT and then sends the file to the designated quarantine directory.
These files are found in the \SUSPECT\Backup folder and are automatically purged after 7 days.
These files are also uploaded to the designated quarantine directory on the product_short_name server.
product_short_name only backs up and encrypts files before cleaning if you select Backup files before cleaning by going to OSCE AV Management and clicking the Settings Scan Settings {Scan Type} Action tab.
product_short_name renames and then moves the infected file to a temporary quarantine directory on the client_computer_single computer_device located in \Suspect.
The default quarantine directory is on the product_short_name server, under \PCCSRV\Virus. product_short_name encrypts quarantined files sent to this directory.
product_short_name renames,encrypts, and moves the infected file to a temporary quarantine directory on the agent endpoint located in \Suspect.
The default quarantine directory is on the product_short_name server, under \PCCSRV\Virus.
To configure the second action, go to OSCE AV Management.
Click Settings Scan Settings {Scan Type} Action tab.
During a Manual Scan, product_short_name still scans the server installation folder.
Also configure product_short_name to exclude Microsoft Exchange 2000/2003 directories by going to the Scan Settings section of OSCE Global Antivirus Settings on the Security Settings tab.
If you use Microsoft Exchange 2007 or later, manually add the directory to the scan exclusion list.
To modify the notification message, select Spyware/Grayware from the Type drop-down in OSCE Client User Notifications.

Security Compliance generates a Compliance Report to help you assess the security status of trend_client_program_plural managed by the product_short_name server.
Components: Use this tab to check if trend_client_program_plural have up-to-date components.
Scan Compliance: Use this tab to check if trend_client_program_plural are running scans regularly.
The Components tab can display trend_client_program_plural running the current and earlier versions of the product.
For the other tabs, only trend_client_program_plural running version 10.5, 10.6, or trend_client_program_plural are shown.
Security Compliance queries the connection status of trend_client_program_plural before generating a Compliance Report.
Each web console user account has a completely independent set of Compliance Report settings.
For example, if you grant a user account permissions to manage domains A and B, the user account's reports will only show data from agents belonging to domains A and B.
Security Compliance can query unmanaged endpoints in the network to which the product_short_name server belongs.
Use Active Directory and IP addresses to query endpoints.
Managed by another product_short_name server
The trend_client_program_plural installed on the computers are managed by another product_short_name server. trend_client_program_plural are online and run either this product_short_name version or an earlier version.
No trend_client_program_single installed
The trend_client_program_single is not installed on the computer_device.
The product_short_name server cannot connect to the computer_device and determine its security status.
Unresolved Active Directory assessment
The computer_device belongs to an Active Directory domain but the product_short_name server is unable to determine its security status.
The product_short_name server database contains a list of client_computer_plural that the server manages.
The server queries Active Directory for the computers' GUIDs and then compares them with GUIDs stored in the database.
If a GUID is not in the database, the computer_device will fall under the Unresolved Active Directory Assessment category.

You can configure product_short_name to ensure that all communication between the server and agents are valid. product_short_name provides public-key cryptography and enhanced encryption features to protect all communication between the server and agents.
If a preexisting certificate exists, product_short_name automatically maps the file on the Server Authentication Certificate screen.
If no preexisting certificate exists, product_short_name defaults to the Generate a new authentication certificate option.
During remote upgrade installations, the Server Authentication Certificate screen only appears if upgrading an OfficeScan 10.6 SP3 server.
product_short_name can generate the authentication certificate during the installation or administrators can import a preexisting authentication certificate from another product_short_name server.
Server Debug Logs Using LogServer.exe
Use LogServer.exe to collect debug logs for the following:
product_short_name server basic logs
Trend Micro Vulnerability Scanner
Active Directory integration logs
Specify if product_short_name client_computer_plural identify the server computer by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN), host (domain) name, or IP address.
Communication between the server computer and client_computer_plural is dependent on the specified IP address.
Changing the IP address results in client_computer_plural not being able to communicate with the product_short_name server.
In most networks, the server computer’s IP address is more likely to change than its host name, thus it is usually preferable to identify the server computer by a host name.
When using static IP addresses, identify the server by its IP address.
In addition, if the server computer has multiple network interface cards (NICs), consider using one of the IP addresses instead of the host name to ensure successful client_computer_single-server communication.
When performing a remote upgrade, product_short_name uses the previous version’s settings.
For administrators using the IP address instead of the host name, company_name does not recommend changing the IP address (obtained from the DHCP server) after the installation.
Administrators can avoid further communication issues with trend_client_program_plural by setting the IP address configuration to Static (on the DHCP server) using the same IP address information obtained from the DHCP server.
Another way to preserve the IP address configuration is to reserve the IP address for the product_short_name server only.
This forces the DHCP server to assign product_short_name the same IP address even when DHCP-enabled.
company_name recommends at least 2GHz dual processors and over 2GB of RAM for the product_short_name server.
The number of networked computer_device client_computer_plural that a single product_short_name server can manage depends on several factors, such as available server resources and network topology.
The server polling feature addresses the issue of unreachable trend_client_program_plural not receiving timely notifications about component updates and changes to client_computer_single settings.
trend_client_program_plural automatically initiate connection with the product_short_name server at regular intervals.
If the product_short_name server or an Update Agent is the primary update source, client_computer_plural obtain both components and new settings.
If the source is not the product_short_name server or Update Agent, client_computer_plural only obtain the updated components and then connect to the product_short_name server or Update Agent to obtain the new settings.
Use Server Tuner to optimize the performance of the product_short_name server using parameters for the following server-related performance issues:
When the number of trend_client_program_plural (including update agents) requesting updates from the product_short_name server exceeds the server's available resources, the server moves the client_computer_single update request into a queue and processes the requests when resources become available.
After the client_computer_single successfully updates components from the product_short_name server, it notifies the server that the update is complete.
Set the maximum number of minutes the product_short_name server waits to receive an update notification from the client_computer_single.
When the product_short_name server receives multiple requests from trend_client_program_plural, such as a request to perform an update, the server handles as many requests as it can and puts the remaining requests in a buffer.
To control the flow of network traffic to the product_short_name server and to other update sources, specify the number of trend_client_program_plural that can simultaneously update at any given time of the day.
Server Tuner requires the following file: SvrTune.exe
ServerProtect Normal Server Migration Tool Logs
To enable debug logging for ServerProtect Normal Server Migration Tool:

To disable debug logging, delete the ofcdebug.ini file.
Security Compliance checks whether the following trend_client_program_single services are functional:
For example, if the trend_client_program_single’s Antivirus service is not functional, the client_computer_single is counted in the Antivirus category.
Restart non-functional services from the web console or from the trend_client_program_single.
The settings may not be consistent if you move any agents to another domain that is applying a different set of settings, or if any agent user with certain privileges manually configured settings on the trend_client_program_single console.
product_short_name verifies the following settings:
Install or upgrade multiple product_short_name servers silently if the servers will use identical installation settings.
When silent installation runs on the target endpoint, Setup installs product_short_name product_version and Plug-in Manager 2.3.
Plug-in Manager 2.3 provides the widget functionality in product_short_name.
Skip Scheduled Scan When a Wireless Endpoint's Battery Life is Less Than __ % and its AC Adapter is Unplugged
product_short_name immediately skips scanning when Scheduled Scan launches if it detects that a wireless computer_device's battery life is running low and its AC adapter is not connected to any power source.
If battery life is low but the AC adapter is connected to a power source, scanning proceeds.
Smart Feedback conref
Trend Micro Smart Feedback provides continuous communication between company_name products and its 24/7 threat research centers and technologies.
You can terminate your participation to the program anytime from the web console.
You do not need to participate in Smart Feedback to protect your computer_device_plural.
Your participation is optional and you may opt out at any time. company_name recommends that you participate in Smart Feedback to help provide better overall protection for all company_name customers.
Trend Micro Smart Feedback shares anonymous threat information with the Smart Protection Network, allowing company_name to rapidly identify and address new threats.
You can disable Smart Feedback anytime through this console.
product_short_name provides a default tab that contains information from Trend Micro Smart Protection Network, which provides File Reputation Services and Web Reputation Services to trend_client_program_plural.
Customize Smart Protection Servers for slower network connections, about 512Kbps, by making changes to the ptngrowth.ini file.
You can install the integrated or standalone Smart Protection Server if the number of client_computer_plural is 1,000 or less.
Install a standalone Smart Protection Server if there are more than 1,000 client_computer_plural.
Because the integrated server and the product_short_name server run on the same computer_device, the computer_device’s performance may reduce significantly during peak traffic for the two servers.
Integrated Smart Protection Server: The product_short_name Setup program includes an integrated Smart Protection Server that installs on the same computer_device where the product_short_name server is installed.
After the installation, manage settings for this server from the product_short_name web console.
The integrated server is intended for small-scale deployments of product_short_name.
Standalone Smart Protection Server: A standalone Smart Protection Server installs on a VMware or Hyper-V server.
The standalone server has a separate management console and is not managed from the product_short_name web console.
Web Reputation Services: Web Reputation Services allows local smart protection sources to host URL reputation data that were previously hosted solely by company_name.
Both technologies ensure smaller bandwidth consumption when updating patterns or checking a URL’s validity.
If you have installed Smart Protection Servers, configure the smart protection source list on the product_short_name web console.
This reduces the traffic directed to the computer_device that hosts the product_short_name server and integrated server.
A custom list defines an IP address range.
If an internal client_computer_single’s IP address is within the range, the client_computer_single uses the custom list.

Smart scan client_computer_plural are trend_client_program_plural that administrators have configured to use File Reputation Services. client_computer_plural_cap that do not use File Reputation Services are called conventional scan client_computer_plural.
Any of the following icons displays when trend_client_program_plural use smart scan.
SMB Protocol conref
SMB Protocol
product_short_name monitors data transmissions through the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which facilitates shared file access.
When another user attempts to copy or read a user’s shared file, product_short_name checks if the file is or contains a data identifier and then allows or blocks the operation.
For example, if Device Control does not allow files on mapped network drives to be moved, transmission of sensitive data does not proceed even if DLP allows it.
For a list of applications that product_short_name monitors for shared file access, see the Data Protection Lists document at:
Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) is a standard protocol used to transport email messages from server to server, and client_computer_single to server, over the Internet.
A Small Network Management Protocol (SNMP) trap is a method of sending notifications to network administrators that use management consoles that support this protocol.
product_short_name can store notification in Management Information Bases (MIBs).
You can use the MIBs browser to view SNMP trap notification.
Windows NT-based operating systems
Vulnerability Scanner can easily install the trend_client_program_single remotely to computers running NT-based operating systems.
Vulnerability Scanner can only install to computers running Windows NT-based operating systems.
Vulnerability Scanner cannot be used with desktop management software.
However, it can help track the progress of the trend_client_program_single installation.
Perform the necessary actions if the trend_client_program_single icon indicates any of the following conditions:
From the web console, configure component update settings in OSCE Client Automatic Update, or grant users the privilege to update in OSCE AV Management > Settings Privileges and Other Settings Privileges (tab) Component Updates.
If the Real-time Scan Service (OfficeScan NT RealTime Scan) has been disabled or becomes non-functional, users must start the service manually from Microsoft Management Console.
Enable Real-time Scan from the web console (OSCE AV Management > Settings Scan Settings Real-time Scan Settings).
Real-time Scan was disabled and the trend_client_program_single is in Independent mode
After disabling Independent mode, enable Real-time Scan from the web console.
Verify the connection from the web console (OSCE Connection Verification) and then check connection verification logs (OSCE Connection Verifications Log).
If the trend_client_program_single is still offline after verification:
If the connection status on both the server and trend_client_program_single is offline, check the network connection.
If the connection status on the trend_client_program_single is offline but online on the server, the server's domain name may have been changed and the trend_client_program_single connects to the server using the domain name (if you select domain name during server installation).
Register the product_short_name server’s domain name to the DNS or WINS server or add the domain name and IP information into the "hosts" file in the following folder on the agent endpoint: \system32\drivers\etc
If the connection status on the trend_client_program_single is online but offline on the server, check the product_short_name firewall settings.
If the connection status on the trend_client_program_single is online but offline on the server, the trend_client_program_single's IP address may have been changed but its status does not reflect on the server (for example, when the client_computer_single is reloaded).
Try to redeploy the trend_client_program_single.
On the web console, go to the Endpoint_Location_title screen (OSCE Client Location) and check if the following computer_device location settings have been configured properly:
Gateway IP addresses
On the web console, go to the Smart Protection Source screen (OSCE Smart Protection Sources) and then perform the following tasks:
Check if the following configuration files on the Smart Protection Server and trend_client_program_single are synchronized:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\TrendMicro\PC-cillinNTCorp\CurrentVersion\iCRC Scan\Scan Server
If LocationProfile=1, the trend_client_program_single is connected to the network and should be able to connect to a Smart Protection Server.
If LocationProfile=2, the trend_client_program_single is not connected to the network and should connect to the Smart Protection Network.
From Internet Explorer, check if the trend_client_program_single endpoint can browse Internet web pages.
Check internal and external proxy settings used to connect to Smart Protection Network and Smart Protection Servers.
For conventional scan agents running Windows XP, Vista, Server 2003 and Server 2008, verify that the OfficeScan NT Proxy Service (TmProxy.exe) is running.
For conventional scan agents running Windows 7, Server 2012, and later versions, verify that the tmusa driver is running.

Managing the Spyware/Grayware Approved List
product_short_name provides a list of "approved" spyware/grayware, which contains files or applications that you do not want treated as spyware or grayware.
When a particular spyware/grayware is detected during scanning, product_short_name checks the approved list and performs no action if it finds a match in the approved list.
The scan action product_short_name performs depends on the scan type that detected the spyware/grayware.
For example, when product_short_name detects any type of spyware/grayware during Manual Scan (scan type), it cleans (action) the affected system resources.
The spyware/grayware scan actions are configurable through the web console only.
The following table lists the actions product_short_name can perform against spyware/grayware.
product_short_name terminates processes or delete registries, files, cookies, and shortcuts.
product_short_name performs no action on detected spyware/grayware components but records the spyware/grayware detection in the logs.
product_short_name will not perform any action if the detected spyware/grayware is included in the approved list.
product_short_name denies access (copy, open) to the detected spyware/grayware components.
product_short_name terminated processes or deleted registries, files, cookies and shortcuts.
product_short_name denied access (copy, open) to the detected spyware/grayware components.
product_short_name did not perform any action but logged the spyware/grayware detection for assessment.
Items to clean exceed 250MB.
The folder is a root directory (such as C: or F:)
product_short_name cleaned spyware/grayware components but the computer_device needs to restart to complete the task.
Spyware/Grayware was detected on a CD-ROM or network drive. product_short_name cannot clean spyware/grayware detected on these locations.
A new version of the Spyware Scan Engine provides a new scan result that product_short_name has not been configured to handle.

SSL Support
SSL tunneling
product_short_name uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for secure communication between the web console and the server.
SSL provides an extra layer of protection against hackers.
Although product_short_name encrypts the passwords specified on the web console before sending them to the product_short_name server, hackers can still sniff the packet and, without decrypting the packet, "replay" it to gain access to the console.
SSL tunneling prevents hackers from sniffing packets traversing the network.
The SSL version used depends on the version that the web server supports.
When selecting SSL, Setup automatically creates an SSL certificate, which is a requirement for SSL connections.
The SSL certificate should have a validity period between 1 and 20 years.
However, a warning message appears every time SSL connection is invoked using the same certificate.
RSA encryption
How communication through SSL works:
The administrator sends information from the web console to the web server through SSL connection.
The web server responds to the web console with the required certificate.
The browser performs key exchange using RSA encryption.
The web console sends data to the web server using RC4 encryption.
Although RSA encryption is more secure, it slows down the communication flow.
Therefore, it is only used for key exchange, and RC4, a faster alternative, is used for data transfer.
This security protocol provides data encryption, server authentication, message integrity, and optional client_computer_single authentication for a TCP/IP connection.
The product_short_name server is the standard update source for Update Agents.
If you configure agents to update directly from the product_short_name server, the update process proceeds as follows:
The Update Agent obtains updates from the product_short_name server.
If unable to update from the product_short_name server, the agent tries connecting directly to the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server if any of the following are true:
When Update Agents update directly from the ActiveUpdate server, significant bandwidth is consumed between the network and the Internet.
The product_short_name firewall is a stateful inspection firewall; it monitors all connections to the trend_client_program_single and remembers all connection states.

The User-defined Approved and Blocked IP lists allow further control over whether endpoints can access specific IP addresses.
Configure these lists when you want to allow access to an address blocked by the Global C&C IP list or block access to an address that may pose a security risk.
The Global C&C IP list works in conjunction with the Network Content Inspection Engine (NCIE) to detect network connections with Trend Micro confirmed C&C servers.
NCIE detects C&C server contact through any network channel.
The Suspicious Connection Service logs all connection information to servers in the Global C&C IP list for evaluation.
For details on enabling the Global C&C IP list, see .
After detecting malware on endpoints through Relevance Rule Pattern matching on network packets, the Suspicious Connection Service can further investigate the connection behavior to determine if a C&C callback occurred.
After detecting a C&C callback, the Suspicious Connection Service can attempt to block and clean the source of the connection using GeneriClean technology.
For details about GeneriClean, see .
Enable the Suspicious Connection Service on the Additional Service Settings screen to protect agents against C&C server callbacks.
product_short_name can log and block all connections made between agents and addresses in the Global C&C IP list.
The Suspicious Connection Settings screen also allows you to log, but still allow access to IP addresses configured in the User-defined Blocked IP List.
product_short_name can also monitor connections that may be the result of a botnet or other malware threat.
After detecting a malware threat, product_short_name can attempt to clean the infection.
Enable the Detect network connections made to addresses in the Global C&C IP list setting to monitor connections made to Trend Micro confirmed C&C servers and select to Log only or Block connections.
To allow agents to connect to addresses in the User-defined Blocked IP list, enable the Log and allow access to User-defined Blocked IP list addresses setting.
You must enable network connection logging before product_short_name can allow access to addresses in the User-defined Blocked IP list.
Malware network fingerprinting performs pattern matching on packet headers. product_short_name logs all connections made by packets with headers that match known malware threats using the Relevance Rule pattern.
To allow product_short_name to attempt to clean connections made to C&C servers, enable the Clean suspicious connections when a C&C callback is detected setting. product_short_name uses GeneriClean to clean the malware threat and terminate the connection to the C&C server.
You must enable Log connections using malware network fingerprinting before product_short_name can attempt to clean the connections made to C&C servers detected by packet structure matching.
Suspicious objects are digital artifacts resulting from an analysis completed by Trend Micro Deep Discovery products or other sources. product_short_name can synchronize suspicious objects and retrieve actions against these objects from a Control Manager 6.0 SP3 or later server (that is connected to Deep Discovery).
After subscribing to Control Manager, select the types of suspicious objects to monitor C&C callbacks or possible targeted attacks identified by client_computer_plural on the network.
Suspicious IP List
In product_short_name 10.6 to 11.0, the primary suspicious object source is Deep Discovery Analyzer.
Starting in product_short_name 11.0 SP1, the primary source is Control Manager 6.0 SP3, which provides a more robust suspicious object management and handling process.
If product_short_name is subscribed to Deep Discovery Analyzer, only the suspicious URL list is available.
After you unsubscribe product_short_name from Deep Discovery Analyzer, it is not possible to re-subscribe. product_short_name must subscribe to Control Manager that is connected to Deep Discovery to synchronize suspicious objects.
For more information about how Control Manager manages suspicious objects, see the Control Manager Administrator's Guide.
Ensure that agents can connect to the product_short_name server.
Also verify that the product_short_name server has the latest components because smart scan agents need to download the Smart Scan Agent Pattern from the server.
Switching a relatively small number of agents at a time allows efficient use of product_short_name server resources.
The product_short_name server can perform other critical tasks while agents change their scan methods.
When switching to smart scan for the first time, agents need to download the full version of the Smart Scan Agent Pattern from the product_short_name server.
A pure IPv6 smart scan agent cannot send queries directly to pure IPv4 sources, such as:
Similarly, a pure IPv4 smart scan agent cannot send queries to pure IPv6 Smart Protection Servers.
A dual-stack proxy server that can convert IP addresses, such as DeleGate, is required to allow smart scan agents to connect to the sources.
Switching a relatively small number of client_computer_plural at a time allows efficient use of product_short_name server and Smart Protection Server resources.
When switching back to conventional scan, client_computer_plural will likely download the full version of the Virus Pattern and Spyware-active Monitoring Pattern from the product_short_name server.
Synchronization Software (ActiveSync)
product_short_name monitors data transmitted to a mobile device through synchronization software.
If the data has a source IP address of 127.0.0.1 and is sent through either port 990 or 5678 (the ports used for synchronization), product_short_name checks if the data is a data identifier before allowing or blocking its transmission.
When product_short_name blocks a file transmitted on port 990, a file of the same name containing malformed characters may still be created at the destination folder on the mobile device.
This is because parts of the file have been copied to the device before product_short_name blocked the transmission.
Synchronize data with Active Directory domains regularly to keep the product_short_name client_computer_single tree structure up-to-date and to query unmanaged client_computer_plural.
Manually Synchronizing Data with Active Directory Domains
Automatically Synchronizing Data with Active Directory Domains
Go to OSCE Scheduled Synchronization.
Select Enable scheduled Active Directory synchronization.
For daily, weekly, and monthly synchronizations, the period of time is the number of hours during which product_short_name synchronizes Active Directory with the product_short_name server.
product_short_name records events related to the server program, such as shutdown and startup.
Use these logs to verify that the product_short_name server and services work properly.
Tabs and Widgets
Widgets are the core components of the dashboard.
Widgets provide specific information about various security-related events.
Some widgets allow you to perform certain tasks, such as updating outdated components.
The information that widgets display comes from:
product_short_name server and
Enable Smart Feedback to display data from Smart Protection Network.
For details about Smart Feedback, see .
The Summary supports up to 30 tabs.
Before allowing remote installation to proceed, Setup needs to first determine if the selected target endpoint(s) can install the product_short_name server.
Setup installs the product_short_name server to that endpoint and ignores the endpoints that did not pass the analysis.

EICAR test script
The European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research (EICAR) developed the EICAR test script as a safe way to confirm proper installation and configuration of antivirus software.
Visit the EICAR website for more information:
The EICAR test script is an inert text file with a .com extension.
Testing the product_short_name Firewall
To ensure that the product_short_name firewall works properly, perform a test on a single trend_client_program_single or group of trend_client_program_plural.
Test trend_client_program_single program settings in a controlled environment only.
Do not perform tests on computer_device_plural connected to the network or to the Internet.
Doing so may expose trend_client_program_single computer_device_plural to viruses, hacker attacks, and other risks.
For example, to prevent the trend_client_program_single from accessing the Internet, do the following:
Create an exception that blocks HTTP (or HTTPS) traffic.
Click OSCE AV Management.
To test a policy configured to prevent the client_computer_single from accessing the Internet, open a web browser on the client_computer_single computer_device.
If you configured product_short_name to display a notification message for firewall violations, the message displays on the client_computer_single computer_device when an outbound traffic violation occurs.
The plug_in_prog_parent_program client_computer_single_cap Tree
The plug_in_prog_parent_program client_computer_single tree displays all the client_computer_plural grouped into domains that the server currently manages. client_computer_plural_cap are grouped into domains so you can simultaneously configure, manage, and apply the same configuration to all domain members.
plug_in_prog_parent_program client_computer_single tree
The company_name_product_name Server Policy Export Tool helps administrators export product_short_name policy settings supported by control_manager_prod 6.0 or later.
Administrators also require the control_manager_prod Import Tool in order to import policies.
The Policy Export Tool supports product_short_name 10.6 Service Pack 1 and later.
Data Loss Prevention settings
product_short_name provides the Server Migration Tool, which allows administrators to copy product_short_name settings from previous product_short_name versions to the current version.
Data Loss Prevention settings*
The Active Directory domain structures display after synchronizing with Active Directory the first time.
Gateway IP address and MAC lists
ofcscan.ini settings

The tool does not back up the trend_client_program_single listings of the product_short_name server; only the domain structures.
trend_client_program_single only migrates features available on the older version of the trend_client_program_single server.
Below is a list of the installation screens (arranged sequentially) that display when you perform a fresh installation of the product_short_name server locally, remotely, or silently.
Analysis may take some time to complete, especially during HTTP server initialization.
The Summary appears when you open the product_short_name web console or click OSCEDashboard in the main menu.
Each web console user account has a completely independent dashboard.
If a dashboard contains product_short_name client_computer_single data, the data that displays depends on the client_computer_single domain permissions for the user account.
For example, if you grant a user account permissions to manage domains A and B, the user account’s dashboard will only show data from client_computer_plural belonging to domains A and B.
Grant users the privilege to uninstall the trend_client_program_single program and then instruct them to run the client_computer_single uninstallation program from their computers.
The banner area of the web console provides the following options:

Log Off: Logs user off from the web console
The web console is the central point for monitoring product_short_name throughout the corporate network.
The web console uses standard Internet technologies, such as JavaScript, CGI, HTML, and HTTPS.
Configure the timeout settings from the web console.
Use the web console to do the following:
Delegate web console administration tasks to other product_short_name administrators by configuring roles and user accounts
The web console does not support Windows 8, 8.1, 10, or Windows Server 2012 in Windows UI mode.
Windows Server Scripts
If you already have an existing login script, Login Script Setup appends a command that executes AutoPcc.exe.
Otherwise, product_short_name creates a batch file called ofcscan.bat that contains the command to run AutoPcc.exe.
Login Script Setup appends the following at the end of the script:
is the endpoint name or IP address of the product_short_name server computer.
"ofcscan" is the product_short_name shared folder name on the server.
"autopcc" is the link to the autopcc executable file that installs the trend_client_program_single.
Windows Server 2003: \\Windows 2003 server\system drive\windir\sysvol\domain\scripts\ofcscan.bat
Remove third-party endpoint security software from the computer_device on which the product_short_name server installation occurs.
These applications may prevent successful product_short_name server installation or affect its performance.
Install the product_short_name server and trend_client_program_single immediately after removing third-party security software to keep the computer_device protected from security risks.
product_short_name cannot automatically uninstall the server component of any third-party antivirus product, but can uninstall the client_computer_single component.

The product_short_name firewall filters all incoming and outgoing traffic, providing the ability to block certain types of traffic based on the following criteria:
Protocol (TCP/UDP/ICMP/ICMPv6)
product_short_name monitors data transmitted outside the host computer.
product_short_name does not monitor data transmitted to these targets.
The only difference is that for non-monitored targets, product_short_name does not log the transmission, whereas for monitored targets, the transmission is always logged.
The following IP addresses are assigned to your company’s Legal Department:
10.201.168.1 to 10.201.168.25
Add 10.201.168.1-10.201.168.25 to the non-monitored targets.
Add the IP addresses of the Legal Department’s part-time staff to the monitored targets.
Assume that there are 3 IP addresses, 10.201.168.21-10.201.168.23.
Add the IP addresses of the Legal Department’s full time staff to the non-monitored targets:
Transmission scope and targets define data transmissions on network channels that product_short_name must monitor.
For transmissions that should be monitored, product_short_name checks for the presence of data identifiers before allowing or blocking the transmission.
For transmissions that should not be monitored, product_short_name does not check for the presence of data identifiers and immediately allows the transmission.
Transmission Scope: Outside the LAN conref
product_short_name monitors data transmitted to any target outside the Local Area Network (LAN).
This includes the current network (IP address of the endpoint and netmask) and the following standard private IP addresses:
Class A: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
Class B: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
Class C: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
Define targets outside the LAN that you consider safe and therefore should not be monitored.
Define targets within the LAN that you want to monitor.

For a list of features available on Windows Server 2008/2012/2016, see .
The trend_client_program_single console is only accessible from the command line interface.
Some trend_client_program_single console screens include a Help button, which, when clicked, opens context-sensitive, HTML-based Help.
Because Windows Server Core 2008/2012/2016 lack a browser, the Help will not be available to the user.
Grant trend_client_program_single users the privilege to view their firewall settings on the trend_client_program_single console.
The trend_client_program_single can be installed on computers running Microsoft Windows platforms. product_short_name is also compatible with various third-party products.
trend_client_program_single_cap Installation and IPv6 Support
This topic discusses considerations when installing the trend_client_program_single to dual-stack or pure IPv6 client_computer_plural.
The trend_client_program_single installation log, OFCNT.LOG, exists on the following locations:
%windir% for all installation methods except MSI package installation
%temp% for the MSI package installation method
AutoPcc.exe automatically installs the trend_client_program_single to an unprotected Windows Server 2003 endpoint when the endpoint logs on to the server whose login scripts you modified.
However, AutoPcc.exe does not automatically install the trend_client_program_single to Windows Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10, Server 2008, Server 2012, and Server 2016 endpoints.
Users need to connect to the server computer, go to \\\ofcscan, right-click AutoPcc.exe, and select Run as administrator.
For remote desktop installation using AutoPcc.exe:
The endpoint must be run in Mstsc.exe /console mode.
Map a drive to the "ofcscan" folder and execute AutoPcc.exe from that point.
Use trend_client_program_single logs (such as debug logs) to troubleshoot trend_client_program_single issues.
Update trend_client_program_single components manually when trend_client_program_single components are severely out-of-date and whenever there is an outbreak. trend_client_program_single components become severely out-of-date when the trend_client_program_single is unable to update components from the update source for an extended period of time.
In addition to initiating manual updates, you can grant users the privilege to run manual updates (also called Update Now on trend_client_program_single computer_device_plural).
If automatic client_computer_single migration is successful but a user encounters problems with the trend_client_program_single right after installation, restart the computer_device.
If the product_short_name installation program proceeded to install the trend_client_program_single but was unable to uninstall the other security software, there will be conflicts between the two software.
Uninstall both software, and then install the trend_client_program_single using any of the installation methods discussed in .
The following topics discuss ways to manage and protect the trend_client_program_single program:
trend_client_program_single_cap Proxy Settings
Configure trend_client_program_plural to use proxy settings when connecting to internal and external servers.
It is preferable for the trend_client_program_single to have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses as some of the entities to which it connects only support IPv4 addressing.
trend_client_program_single_cap Service Restart
product_short_name restarts trend_client_program_single services that stopped responding unexpectedly and were not stopped by a normal system process.
Configure the necessary settings to enable trend_client_program_single services to restart.
You can view the status of these services from Microsoft Management Console.
product_short_name firewall
OfficeScan NT Listener (tmlisten.exe)
Communication between the trend_client_program_single and product_short_name server
OfficeScan NT RealTime Scan (ntrtscan.exe)
OfficeScan Common Client Solution Framework (TmCCSF.exe)
For this reason, these services are disabled by default on server platforms (Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2012).
For TMBMSRV.exe, you can enable the service if you exempt system-intensive applications from Behavior Monitoring policies.
The following trend_client_program_single services display on Microsoft Management Console:
The OfficeScan NT Proxy Service does not exist on Windows 7/8/8.1/10, or Windows Server 2008 R2/2012/2016 platforms.
OfficeScan NT Firewall (TmPfw.exe); if the firewall was enabled during installation
The trend_client_program_single shortcuts appear on the Windows Start menu on the agent endpoint.
Not available on Windows 8/8.1/10 or Windows Server 2012/2012 R2/2016 platforms.
There are two ways to uninstall the trend_client_program_single from computers:
If the trend_client_program_single cannot be uninstalled using the above methods, manually uninstall the trend_client_program_single.
The trend_client_program_single unloading and unlocking privilege allows users to temporarily stop the trend_client_program_single or gain access to advanced web console features with or without a password.
trend_client_program_plural that update components from the product_short_name server or a customized update source can use the following update methods:
Privilege-based updates: Users with update privileges have greater control over how the trend_client_program_single on their computers gets updated.
This topic discusses the update process for trend_client_program_plural.
If you configure trend_client_program_plural to update directly from the product_short_name server, the update process proceeds as follows:
The trend_client_program_single obtains updates from the product_short_name server.
If unable to update from the product_short_name server, the trend_client_program_single tries connecting directly to the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server if the option OfficeScan agents download updates from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate Server is enabled in OSCE Client Tree, click Settings Privileges and Other Settings Other Settings (tab) Update Settings.
Domain settings, programs and hot fixes can only be downloaded from the product_short_name server or Update Agents.
You can speed up the update process by configuring trend_client_program_plural to only download pattern files from the ActiveUpdate server.
If unable to update from the first source, the trend_client_program_single updates from the second source, and so on.
If unable to update from all sources, the trend_client_program_single checks the following settings on the Update Source screen:
If this setting is enabled, Update Agents update directly from the product_short_name server and disregard the Customized Update Source List.
If this setting is enabled, the client_computer_single updates components from the product_short_name server.
In OSCE Client Tree, click Settings Privileges and Other Settings Other Settings (tab) Update Settings, the option OfficeScan agents download updates from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate Server is enabled.
If this setting is enabled, the client_computer_single updates domain-level settings from the product_short_name server.
If this setting enabled, the client_computer_single updates programs and hot fixes from the product_short_name server.
client_computer_plural_cap can obtain updates from the standard update source (product_short_name server) or specific components from custom update sources such as the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server.
Before updating agents, check if their update source (product_short_name server or a custom update source) has the latest components.
For information on how to update the product_short_name server, see .

The Microsoft Hyper-V connection uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and DCOM for client_computer_single-server communication.
Firewall policies may block this communication, causing an unsuccessful connection to the Hyper-V server.
The Hyper-V server listening port defaults to port 135 and then chooses a randomly configured port for further communication.
If the firewall blocks WMI traffic or either of these two ports, communication with the server is unsuccessful.
Administrators can modify the firewall policy to allow successful communication with the Hyper-V server.
Verify that all connection settings, including IP address, domain\username, and password are correct before performing the following firewall modifications.

This chapter provides a list of resources you can use to troubleshoot product_short_name server and trend_client_program_single issues.
For example, if the scan engine is set to scan all executable files and it encounters a file named “family.gif”, it does not assume the file is a graphic file.
For example, .gif files make up a large volume of all web traffic, but they are unlikely to harbor viruses/malware, launch executable code, or carry out any known or theoretical exploits.
The server and the trend_client_program_single use trusted ports to communicate with each other.
product_short_name uses the HTTP port (by default, 8080) as the trusted port on the server.
To block this trusted port and the trusted port on the trend_client_program_single, select the Block trusted ports check box on the Port Blocking screen.
The master installer randomly generates the trend_client_program_single trusted port during installation.
You can grant end users the privilege to configure product_short_name to skip scanning of trusted processes during Real-time and Behavior Monitoring scans.
Based on one-way communication but with an extra HTTP-based channel that receives server notifications, two-way communication can improve real time dispatching and processing of commands from the server by the MCP agent.

Uninstalling the OfficeScan Server Using the Uninstallation...
This chapter describes the steps for uninstalling or rolling back Trend Micro OfficeScan.
Uninstalling Data Protection from Plug-in Manager
On the Plug-in Manager screen, go to the OfficeScan Data Protection section and click Uninstall.
Refresh the Plug-in Manager screen after the uninstallation.
product_short_name Data Protection is again available for installation.
If you uninstall the Data Protection module from Plug-in Manager:
All Data Loss Prevention configurations, settings, and logs are removed from the product_short_name server.
Data Loss Prevention policies will no longer be enforced on client_computer_plural.
Uninstalling plug_ins_prod_name_titles from the Plug-in Manager Console
The plug-in program is again available for installation.
Uninstalling Plug-in Manager
Uninstall the plug_in_prog_parent_program server to uninstall Plug-in Manager and all installed plug-in programs.
Uninstalling the trend_client_program_single_cap from the Web Console
Uninstall the trend_client_program_single program from the web console.
Click Tasks Agent Uninstallation.
Click Stop Uninstallation to prompt product_short_name to stop notifying client_computer_plural currently being notified. client_computer_plural_cap already notified and already performing uninstallation ignore this command.
Unload and Uninstall the trend_client_program_single_cap
Specify a password to prevent unauthorized uninstallation or unloading of the trend_client_program_single.
trend_client_program_plural on unreachable networks, such as those on network segments behind a NAT gateway, are almost always offline because the server cannot establish direct connection with the client_computer_plural.
Apply client_computer_single settings configured from the web console.
For example, when you change the Scheduled Scan frequency from the web console, the server will immediately notify client_computer_plural to apply the new setting.
product_short_name provides the "heartbeat" and server polling features to resolve issues regarding unreachable client_computer_plural.
product_short_name no longer supports Windows 95, 98, Me, NT, 2000, or the Itanium architecture platform.
If you plan to upgrade to this version and you have OfficeScan agents that run these operating systems:
Do not upgrade all OfficeScan servers to this product_short_name version.
Designate at least one OfficeScan server (parent server) to manage agents running unsupported operating systems.
Log on to the web console and click Networked Computers Client Management on the main menu.
On the client tree, select the clients that you want to move and then click Manage Client Tree Move Client.
Specify the parent server's computer name/IP address and server listening port under Move selected client(s) to another OfficeScan Server.
Log on to the web console and click OSCE Client Tree on the main menu.
On the agent tree, select the agents that you want to move and then click Manage Agent Tree Move Agent.
Specify the parent server's computer name/IP address and server listening port under Move selected agent(s) to another OfficeScan Server.
This report includes all trend_client_program_plural configured to receive partial updates from Update Agents.
If you have delegated the task of managing one or several domains to other administrators, they will also see all trend_client_program_plural configured to receive partial updates from Update Agents belonging to the domains that they are not managing.
product_short_name exports the Update Agent Analytical Report to a comma-separated value (.csv) file.
trend_client_program_single programs and hot fixes
The Update Agent Analytical Report only lists trend_client_program_plural configured to receive partial updates from an Update Agent. trend_client_program_plural configured to perform complete updates from an Update Agent (including components, domain settings, and trend_client_program_single programs and hot fixes) do not appear in the report.
Like the product_short_name server, Update Agents also use component duplication when downloading components.
If the difference between the two versions is 14 or less, the Update Agent downloads the incremental pattern that accounts for the difference between the two versions.
If the difference is more than 14, the Update Agent automatically downloads the full version of the pattern file.
Assign the trend_client_program_single as an Update Agent for specific components.
Assigning a Trend Micro Endpoint as an Update Agent
If there are low-bandwidth or heavy traffic sections of the network between client_computer_plural and the product_short_name server, designate selected product_short_name client_computer_plural as Update Agents, or update sources for other client_computer_plural.
For example, if you have a remote office with 20 or more computer_device_plural, designate an Update Agent to replicate updates from the product_short_name server and act as a distribution point for other client_computer_single computer_device_plural on the local network.
To distribute the task of deploying components, domain settings, or client_computer_single programs and hot fixes to trend_client_program_plural, assign some trend_client_program_plural to act as Update Agents, or update sources for other client_computer_plural.
This helps ensure that client_computer_plural receive updates in a timely manner without directing a significant amount of network traffic to the product_short_name server.
trend_client_program_plural assigned to update components from an Update Agent only receive updated components and settings from the Update Agent.
All trend_client_program_plural still report their status back to the product_short_name server.
512MB (1GB for Update Agents running Windows Vista)
1GB or more recommended (1.5GB or more for Update Agents running Windows Vista)
At least 700MB
At least 1GB if the Update Agent deploys hot fixes and the OfficeScan agent program
When updates are available, the product_short_name server and smart protection sources (Smart Protection Server or Smart Protection Network) download the updated components.
There are no component download overlaps between the product_short_name server and smart protection sources because each one downloads a specific set of components.
You can configure both the product_short_name server and Smart Protection Server to update from a source other than the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server.
OfficeScan agents download updates from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate Server
If the update is unsuccessful, the client_computer_plural attempt to update from the product_short_name server.
Selecting this option enables client_computer_plural to attempt to update from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server if the update from the product_short_name server is unsuccessful.
Enable schedule-based updates on OfficeScan agents
Selecting this option configures all trend_client_program_plural to enable schedule-based updates by default.
OfficeScan agents can update components but not upgrade the agent program or deploy hot fixes
This option allows component updates to proceed but prevents hot fix deployment and trend_client_program_single upgrade.
Disabling this option may significantly affect server performance as all client_computer_plural simultaneously connect to the server to upgrade or install a hot fix.
Users with this privilege can update components on demand by right-clicking the trend_client_program_single icon on the system tray and selecting Update Now.
trend_client_program_single users can use proxy settings during "Update Now".
Selecting this option allows trend_client_program_single users to enable and disable scheduled updates using the trend_client_program_single right-click menu, which can override the Enable Schedule-based Updates setting.
Administrators must first select the Enable schedule-based updates on OfficeScan agents setting on the Other Settings tab before the menu item appears on the trend_client_program_single menu.
Update Settings on the OLD OfficeScan Server conref
Go to Networked Computers Client Management.
On the client tree, click the root domain icon () to select all clients.
Click Settings Privileges and Other Settings and go to the Other Settings tab.
Select Clients can update components but not upgrade the client program or deploy hot fixes.
OfficeScan clients that do not apply the settings automatically upgrade.
On the agent tree, click the root domain icon () to select all agents.
Select OfficeScan agents can update components but not upgrade the agent program or deploy hot fixes.
OfficeScan agents that do not apply the settings automatically upgrade.
Update Agents can obtain updates from various sources, such as the product_short_name server or a customized update source.
Configure the update source from the web console’s Update Source screen.
A pure IPv6 Update Agent cannot distribute updates directly to pure IPv4 client_computer_plural.
Similarly, a pure IPv4 Update Agent cannot distribute updates directly to pure IPv6 client_computer_plural.
A dual-stack proxy server that can convert IP addresses, such as DeleGate, is required to allow the Update Agent to distribute updates to the client_computer_plural.
When initiating updates, trend_client_program_plural first get updates from the update source specified on the OSCE Client Update Source screen.
Updating an Isolated product_short_name Server
Identify the update source, such as company_name_control_manager_prod or a random host machine.
A reliable Internet connection so that it can download the latest components from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server.
Without Internet connection, the only way for the update source to have the latest components is if you obtain the components yourself from company_name and then copy them into the update source.
A functional connection with the product_short_name server.
Configure proxy settings if there is a proxy server between the product_short_name server and the update source.
Point the product_short_name server to the new update source.
One of the ways to determine if a component is being deployed to client_computer_plural is by going to the Update Summary screen on the web console (OSCE Client Update Summary).
In this screen, the update rate for a component that is being deployed will always be larger than 0%.
The server’s URL depends on your product_short_name version.
The server.ini file.
The components you identified in step 3.
Run a manual update of the product_short_name server.
Repeat step 5 to step 6 each time you need to update components.
After Plug-in Manager downloads the package, a new screen displays.
After the upgrade, the Plug-in Manager service may need to restart, causing the plugin_manager_screen_title screen to be temporarily unavailable.
Updating trend_client_program_plural_cap Manually
Go to OSCE Client Manual Update.
The components currently available on the product_short_name server and the date these components were last updated display on top of the screen.
To check the notification status, go to the OSCE Client Update Summary screen.
Disable OfficeScan agents can update components but not upgrade the agent program or deploy hot fixes.
Go to Updates Networked Computers Automatic Update and ensure that the following options are enabled:
Initiate component update on clients immediately after the OfficeScan server downloads a new component.
Let clients initiate component update when they restart and connect to the OfficeScan server (roaming clients are excluded)
Go to OSCE Client Automatic Update and ensure that the following options are enabled:
Initiate component update on agents immediately after the OfficeScan server downloads a new component.
Let agents initiate component update after restarting and connecting to the OfficeScan server (roaming agents excluded)
Consider the following when upgrading the product_short_name server and client_computer_plural:
Upgrade Method 1: Disable Automatic Agent Upgrade
The product_short_name server downloads a new component and notifies agents to update.
The agent restarts and then connects to the product_short_name server.
Any agent endpoint running Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP Professional logs on to a server whose login script you modified using Login Script Setup (AutoPcc.exe).
Create and deploy an EXE or MSI trend_client_program_single package.
If the agent endpoint runs Windows Server 2003, XP Professional, Server 2008, Vista (all editions except Vista Home), 7 (all editions except 7 Home), Windows 8 (Pro/Enterprise), Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2016, instruct the user to perform the following steps:
Navigate to \\\ofcscan.
Launch AutoPcc.exe.
If the agent endpoint runs Windows Vista Home, Windows 7 Home, Windows 8, or Windows 10, instruct the user to right-click AutoPcc.exe, and select Run as administrator.
trend_client_program_plural that do not update from Update Agents will upgrade from the OfficeScan server.
Upgrade Method 3: Move Agents to the product_short_name product_version Server
Perform a fresh installation of the product_short_name product_version server and then move agents to this server.
When you move the agents, they automatically upgrade to product_short_name product_version.
Upgrade Method 4: Enable Automatic Agent Upgrade
After upgrading the product_short_name server to this version, the server immediately notifies all agents it manages to upgrade.
Part 1: Perform a fresh installation of the OfficeScan server and then configure update settings
Perform a fresh installation of the product_short_name product_version server.
Record the following product_short_name product_version server information.
Specify this information on the OfficeScan 10.x server when moving agents:
Part 2: Upgrade trend_client_program_plural_cap
On the previous version OfficeScan web console, go to Updates Summary.
This function clears the server notification queue, which will prevent problems moving clients/agents to the product_short_name product_version server.
For OfficeScan 10.x servers: Networked Computers Client Management
For OfficeScan 11.x servers:OSCE Client Tree
For OfficeScan 10.x servers:
Click Manage Client Tree Move Client.
Specify the product_short_name product_version server computer name/IP address and server listening port under Move selected client(s) online to another OfficeScan Server.
Specify the product_short_name product_version server computer name/IP address and server listening port under Move selected agent(s) online to another OfficeScan Server.
For agents that are offline for an extended period of time, instruct users to uninstall the agent from the endpoint and then use a suitable agent installation method (such as agent packager) discussed in the Administrator's Guide to install the trend_client_program_single.
Part 3:Upgrade Update Agents
Repeat step 1to step 11 until all Update Agents have been upgraded.
Part 4:Configure Update Agent Settings
Wait for the Update Agent to finish downloading the agent program before proceeding to Part 5.
Repeat step 1 to step 6 until all Update Agents have applied the necessary settings.
upgrade/hot fix logs
Local Upgrades from OfficeScan 10.6 SP3 with Apache
During an upgrade installation from OfficeScan 10.6 SP3 with the Apache server installed, the following screens appear:
This release of product_short_name discontinues support for the Apache web server.
During an upgrade from OfficeScan 10.6 SP3 that uses the Apache server, product_short_name informs you that the Setup program will install the IIS web server role on the server.
After the installation completes, product_short_name no longer uses the Apache server.
product_short_name can only replace the Apache server with the IIS server if you installed the Apache server using the previous OfficeScan Setup program.
If you installed Apache manually, you must uninstall the Apache server before upgrading product_short_name.
Local Upgrades from OfficeScan 10.6 SP3 with IIS
During an upgrade installation from OfficeScan 10.6 SP3 with the IIS server installed, the following screens appear:
Local Upgrades from OfficeScan 11.x
During an upgrade installation from OfficeScan 11.0 (or later), the following screens appear:
This screen only appears if your previous OfficeScan server uses the Apache web server.
During an upgrade from OfficeScan 11.0 that uses the Apache server, product_short_name informs you that the Setup program will install the IIS web server role on the server.
This chapter describes the steps in upgrading company_name_trademarked product_name_trademarked.
Upgrading the product_short_name Server and Agents
Running Setup on a previously configured product_short_name 10.x or 11.x server upgrades the server.
If Plug-in Manager is installed on the endpoint, Setup also upgrades Plug-in Manager to version 2.3.
If Plug-in Manager is not installed, version 2.3 will automatically be installed.
If the product_short_name server allows agents to upgrade the trend_client_program_single program, the installation package immediately upgrades all agents after the server installation completes.
If the product_short_name server blocks agent upgrades, depending on network bandwidth and the number of agents the product_short_name server manages, stagger the agent upgrade in groups.
company_name highly recommends restarting the trend_client_program_plural after upgrading to ensure that all product_short_name components have been updated.
client_computer_plural_cap that are currently in your intranet can connect to a Smart Protection Server to query the Smart Scan Pattern or Web Blocking List.
client_computer_plural_cap that are currently not in your intranet can connect to Trend Micro Smart Protection Network for queries.
Internet connection is required to connect to the Smart Protection Network.
client_computer_plural_cap without access to the network or the Internet still benefit from protection provided by the Smart Scan Agent Pattern and the cache containing previous query results.
Pattern file: client_computer_plural_cap download the Smart Scan Agent Pattern file from the OfficeScan server or a custom update source.
Without access to the intranet but with connection to Smart Protection Network
Pattern file: client_computer_plural_cap do not download the latest Smart Scan Agent Pattern file unless connection to the product_short_name server or a custom update source is available.
If you choose "Clean" as the first action, select a second action that product_short_name performs if cleaning is unsuccessful.
If you choose "Clean" as the first action, product_short_name performs the second action when it detects probable virus/malware.
The user role determines the web console menu items a user can view or configure.
During product_short_name server installation, Setup automatically creates a built-in account called "root".
Users who log on using the root account can access all menu items.
You cannot delete the root account but you can modify account details, such as the password and full name or the account description.
If you forget the root account password, contact your support provider for help in resetting the password.
Add custom accounts or Active Directory accounts.
All user accounts display on the User Accounts list on the web console.
product_short_name user accounts can be used to perform "single sign-on".
Single sign-on allows users to access the product_short_name web console from the company_name_control_manager_prod console.
A user role determines the web console menu items accessible to a user.
The product_short_name server maintains expired certificates for client_computer_plural with expired public keys.

Although once most common in DOS or Windows, computer_device viruses today can cause a great amount of damage by exploiting vulnerabilities in corporate networks, email systems and websites.
Packers are compressed and/or encrypted Windows or Linux executable programs, often a Trojan horse program.
Rootkits are programs (or collections of programs) that install and execute code on a system without end user consent or knowledge.
Rootkits do not infect machines, but rather, seek to provide an undetectable environment for malicious code to execute.
Rootkits are installed on systems via social engineering, upon execution of malware, or simply by browsing a malicious website.
Use test viruses, such as the EICAR test script, to verify that your antivirus installation scans properly.

The scan action product_short_name performs depends on the virus/malware type and the scan type that detected the virus/malware.
For example, when product_short_name detects a Trojan horse program (virus/malware type) during Manual Scan (scan type), it cleans (action) the infected file.
The following are the actions product_short_name can perform against viruses/malware.
product_short_name deletes the infected file.
If you need to restore any of the quarantined files, use the VSEncrypt tool.
product_short_name cleans the infected file before allowing full access to the file.
If the file is uncleanable, product_short_name performs a second action, which can be one of the following actions: Quarantine, Delete, Rename, and Pass.
product_short_name changes the infected file's extension to "vir".
When product_short_name detects an attempt to open or execute an infected file, it immediately blocks the operation.
This is because attempting to clean a boot virus may damage the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the infected endpoint.
Run Manual Scan so product_short_name can clean or quarantine the file.
First action is Pass. product_short_name did not perform any action on the infected file.
Second action is Pass so product_short_name did not perform any action on the infected file.
This scan result only displays when product_short_name detects "probable virus/malware" during Manual Scan, Scheduled Scan, and Scan Now.
Explanation 1
The infected file may be locked by another application, is executing, or is on a CD. product_short_name will quarantine/rename the file after the application releases the file or after it has been executed.
For infected files on a CD, consider not using the CD as the virus may infect other endpoints on the network.
The infected file is in the Temporary Internet Files folder of the agent endpoint.
Since the endpoint downloads files while you are browsing, the web browser may have locked the infected file.
When the web browser releases the file, product_short_name will quarantine/rename the file.
The infected file may be contained in a compressed file and the Clean/Delete infected files within compressed files setting in OSCE Global Antivirus Settings on the Security Settings tab is disabled.
When enabled, product_short_name decompresses a compressed file, cleans/deletes infected files within the compressed file, and then re-compresses the file.
The infected file may be locked by another application, is executing, or is on a CD. product_short_name will delete the file after the application releases the file or after it has been executed.
The infected file is in the Temporary Internet Files folder of the trend_client_program_single endpoint.
When the web browser releases the file, product_short_name will delete the file.
Although product_short_name successfully quarantined a file in the \Suspect folder of the trend_client_program_single endpoint, it cannot send the file to the designated quarantine directory.
Determine which scan type (Manual Scan, Real-time Scan, Scheduled Scan, or Scan Now) detected the virus/malware and then check the quarantine directory specified in OSCE AV Management > Settings {Scan Type} Action tab.
If the quarantine directory is on the product_short_name server computer or is on another product_short_name server computer:
If you use URL as the quarantine directory format:
Ensure that the endpoint name you specify after http:// is correct.
If it exceeds the maximum file size specified in OSCE Quarantine Manager, adjust the setting to accommodate the file.
Check the size of the quarantine directory folder and determine whether it has exceeded the folder capacity specified in OSCE Quarantine Manager.
If you use UNC path, ensure that the quarantine directory folder is shared to the group Everyone and that you assign read and write permission to this group.
Also check if the quarantine directory folder exists and if the UNC path is correct.
If the quarantine directory is on another endpoint on the network (You can only use UNC path for this scenario):
Check if the trend_client_program_single can connect to the endpoint.
Ensure that the quarantine directory folder is shared to the group Everyone and that you assign read and write permission to this group.
Check if the UNC path is correct.
If the quarantine directory is on a different directory on the trend_client_program_single endpoint (you can only use absolute path for this scenario), check if the quarantine directory folder exists.
When the web browser releases the file, product_short_name will clean the file.
product_short_name is unable to complete the configured action on the infected file without user intervention.

Vul Scanner Server Settings conref
product_short_name Server Settings
product_short_name server settings are used when:
Vulnerability Scanner installs the trend_client_program_single to unprotected target machines.
Server settings allow Vulnerability Scanner to identify the trend_client_program_single’s parent server and the administrative credentials to use when logging on to the target machines.
Vulnerability Scanner sends client_computer_single installation logs to the product_short_name server.
You can install the trend_client_program_single to the target host machine using the other installation methods discussed in .
Vulnerability scan checks the presence of security software on host machines and can install the trend_client_program_single to unprotected host machines.
DHCP scan
Administrators can run vulnerability scans on host machines requesting IP addresses from a DHCP server.
Vulnerability Scanner listens on port 67, which is the DHCP server’s listening port for DHCP requests.
If it detects a DHCP request from a host machine, vulnerability scan runs on the machine.
Vulnerability Scanner is unable to detect DHCP requests if you launched it on Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, or Windows Server 2012.
After Vulnerability Scanner runs, it displays the status of the trend_client_program_single on the target host machines.
Not installed: The TMListen service is missing or the trend_client_program_single has not been installed
Unreachable: Vulnerability Scanner was unable to establish connection with the host machine and determine the status of the trend_client_program_single
You can configure Vulnerability Scanner to save the vulnerability scan results to a comma-separated value (CSV) file.
Vulnerability scan settings are configured from Trend Micro Vulnerability Scanner (TMVS.exe) or from the TMVS.ini file.

Send the following instructions to users to install the trend_client_program_single from the web install page.
Web Reputation policies dictate whether product_short_name blocks or allows access to a website.
Selecting Enable web reputation policy enables policies for internal and external client_computer_plural installed on desktop platforms, such as Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1.
Select Enable web reputation policy on server platforms if server platforms, such as Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2012, require the same level of web threat protection as desktop platforms.
trend_client_program_plural use the location criteria configured in the web console’s Endpoint Location screen to determine their location and the policy to apply. trend_client_program_plural switch policies each time the location changes.
Configure web reputation policy settings from the web console after installation. product_short_name administrators typically configure a stricter policy for external client_computer_plural.
Web reputation policies are granular settings in the product_short_name client_computer_single tree.
When enabling web reputation policies, be sure to install Smart Protection Servers (integrated or standalone) and add them to the smart protection source list on the product_short_name web console. trend_client_program_plural send web reputation queries to the servers to verify the safety of websites that users are accessing.
The integrated server installs with the product_short_name server.
Web reputation policies dictate whether product_short_name will block or allow access to a website.
You can configure policies for internal and external client_computer_plural. product_short_name administrators typically configure a stricter policy for external client_computer_plural.

Specify proxy server authentication credentials if you have set up a proxy server to handle HTTP communication in your organization and authentication is required before web access is allowed.
company_name recommends disabling web reputation for internal agents if you already use a company_name product with the web reputation capability, such as InterScan Web Security Virtual Appliance.
For details about this option, see step 7.
Select Check HTTPS URLs.
HTTPS communication uses certificates to identify web servers.
Although more secure, accessing websites using HTTPS still has risks.
In addition, certificates are relatively easy to obtain, making it easy to set up malicious web servers that use HTTPS.
Enable checking of HTTPS URLs to reduce exposure to compromised and malicious sites that use HTTPS. product_short_name can monitor HTTPS traffic on the following browsers:
Supported Browsers for HTTPS Traffic
6 with SP2 or higher
3.5 or later
HTTPS scanning only supports Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, or Windows 2012 platforms operating in desktop mode.
After enabling HTTPS scanning for the first time on trend_client_program_plural, users must enable the required add-on in the browser before HTTPS scanning is operational.
For trend_client_program_plural running Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10, Server 2008 R2, or Server 2012, users must enable the Trend Micro Osprey Firefox Extension 2.0.0.1077 add-on in the browser pop-up window (or in the Add-ons Extensions screen).
For trend_client_program_plural running Windows XP, Vista, Server 2003 or Server 2008, users must enable the Trend Micro NSC Firefox Extension 5.82.0.1092 add-on in the browser pop-up window (or in the Add-ons Extensions screen).
Internet Explorer 9, 10, and 11
For trend_client_program_plural running Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10, Server 2008 R2, or Server 2012, users must enable the Trend Micro Osprey Plugin Class add-on in the browser pop-up window.
For trend_client_program_plural running Windows XP, Vista, Server 2003, or Server 2008, users must enable the TmIEPlugInBHO Class add-on in the browser pop-up window.
You must enable Behavior Monitoring and the Advanced Protection Service on agents to scan HTTPS traffic using the Microsoft Edge browser.
For more information on configuring Internet Explorer settings for web reputation, see the following Knowledge Base articles:
Select Scan common HTTP ports only to restrict web reputation scanning to traffic through ports 80, 81, and 8080. By default, product_short_name scans all traffic through all ports.
Not supported on Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10, or Windows Server 2008 R2, 2012 or later platforms.
The only remaining sources of web reputation data for agents are the approved and blocked URL lists (configured in step 10).
Agent endpoints must have Internet connection to send queries successfully.
Agents will block untested websites if you select Block pages that have not been tested by Trend Micro in step 11.
The security levels determine whether product_short_name will allow or block access to a URL.
For example, if you set the security level to Low, product_short_name only blocks URLs that are known to be web threats.
If you disabled the Send queries to Smart Protection Servers option in step 9, you can select Block pages that have not been tested by Trend Micro.
product_short_name utilizes both the Browser Exploit Prevention pattern and the Script Analyzer pattern to identify and block web pages before exposing the system.
When a URL matches an entry in the approved list, agents always allow access to the URL, even if it is in the blocked list.
Type a URL.
You can add a wildcard character (*) anywhere on the URL.
Typing www.trendmicro.com/* means that all pages in the company_name website will be approved.
Typing *.trendmicro.com/* means that all pages on any sub-domain of trendmicro.com will be approved.
You can type URLs containing IP addresses.
If a URL contains an IPv6 address, enclose the address in parentheses.
To submit web reputation feedback, click the URL provided under Reassess URL.
Select whether to allow the trend_client_program_single to send web reputation logs to the server.
Allow agents to send logs if you want to analyze URLs being blocked by product_short_name and take the appropriate action on URLs you think are safe to access.

Many malicious programs create copies of themselves or other malicious programs using file names used by Windows system files.
Hosts File Modification
The Hosts file matches domain names with IP addresses.
Spyware/grayware programs often install unwanted Internet Explorer plugins, including toolbars and Browser Helper Objects.
Many virus/malware change Internet Explorer settings, including the home page, trusted websites, proxy server settings, and menu extensions.
Many malicious programs configure Windows so that all applications automatically load a program library (DLL).
This allows the malicious routines in the DLL to run every time an application starts.
Many malicious programs modify Windows shell settings to associate themselves to certain file types.
This routine allows malicious programs to launch automatically if users open the associated files in Windows Explorer.
Changes to Windows shell settings can also allow malicious programs to track the programs used and start alongside legitimate applications.
Windows services are processes that have special functions and typically run continuously in the background with full administrative access.
Certain Windows system files determine system behavior, including startup programs and screen saver settings.

Hot fixes are issue-specific, and therefore not released to all customers.
Windows hot fixes include a Setup program, while non-Windows hot fixes do not (typically you need to stop the program daemons, copy the file to overwrite its counterpart in your installation, and restart the daemons).
Performance optimization: IntelliScan does not affect applications on the client_computer_single because it uses minimal system resources.
The product_short_name firewall also includes an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).
The product_short_name firewall can help prevent the following well-known intrusions:
Too Big Fragment
A Denial of Service attack where a hacker directs an oversized TCP/UDP packet at a target computer_device.
Ping of Death
A Denial of Service attack where a hacker directs an oversized ICMP/ICMPv6 packet at a target computer_device.
Conflicted ARP
A type of attack where a hacker sends an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) request with the same source and destination IP address to a targeted computer_device.
The target computer_device continually sends an ARP response (its MAC address) to itself, causing it to freeze or crash.
SYN Flood
A Denial of Service attack where a program sends multiple TCP synchronization (SYN) packets to the computer_device, causing the computer_device to continually send synchronization acknowledgment (SYN/ACK) responses.
Overlapping Fragment
Similar to a Teardrop attack, this Denial of Service attack sends overlapping TCP fragments to the computer_device.
This overwrites the header information in the first TCP fragment and may pass through a firewall.
Similar to an overlapping fragment attack, this Denial of Service attack deals with IP fragments.
A confusing offset value in the second or later IP fragment can cause the receiving computer_device’s operating system to crash when attempting to reassemble the fragments.
Tiny Fragment Attack
A type of attack where a small TCP fragment size forces the first TCP packet header information into the next fragment.
Fragmented IGMP
A Denial of Service attack that sends fragmented IGMP packets to a target computer_device, which cannot properly process the IGMP packets.
LAND Attack
A type of attack that sends IP synchronization (SYN) packets with the same source and destination address to the computer_device, causing the computer_device to send the synchronization acknowledgment (SYN/ACK) response to itself.
Displays information about the current state of the trend_client_program_single and the computer_device that it protects.

The trend_client_program_single then sends quarantined files to the designated quarantine directory, which is on the prod_server_name by default.
The trend_client_program_single encrypts quarantined files sent to this directory.
If the file is uncleanable, the trend_client_program_single performs a second action, which can be one of the following actions: Quarantine, Delete, Rename, and Pass.
Changes the infected file's extension to vir.
When the trend_client_program_single detects an attempt to open or execute an infected file, it immediately blocks the operation.
Display a notification when virus/malware is detected: Select to display a notification informing the trend_client_program_single user when a malware detection occurs
Scan POP3 messages
By default, Mail Scan can only scan new messages sent through port 110 in the Inbox and Junk Mail folders.
It does not support secure POP3 (SSL-POP3), which is used by Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 by default.
Outlook Express 6.0 with Service Pack 2 (on Windows XP only)
Windows Mail (on Microsoft Vista only)
Mozilla Thunderbird 1.5 and 2.0
Mail Scan cannot detect security risks in IMAP messages.
Use the messaging_security_agent (Advanced only) to detect security risks and spam in IMAP messages.
Enable IntelliTrap
IntelliTrap detects malicious code, such as bots, in compressed files.
Enable CVE exploit scanning for files downloaded through web and email channels
Blocks processes that attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in commercially available products based on the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system.
The trend_client_program_single can pause after scanning one file and before scanning the next file.
Scan the boot sector of the USB storage device after plugging in
Automatically scans only the boot sector of a USB storage device every time the user plugs it in.
Scan all files on the USB storage device after plugging in
Automatically scans all files on a USB storage device every time the user plugs it in.
Scan OLE files up to layer
When a file contains multiple Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) layers, product_short_name scans the specified number of layers and ignores the remaining layers.
The specified number of layers is applicable to both the Scan OLE files up to layer and Detect exploit code in OLE files options.
Allows product_short_name to detect and then scan hidden folders on the computer_device.
Run advanced cleanup (For FakeAV)
The messaging_security_agent stops activities by rogue security software, also known as FakeAV.
The agent also uses advanced cleanup rules to proactively detect and stop applications that exhibit FakeAV behavior.
Wildcard characters, such as “*”, are not accepted for file extensions.
(Advanced only) If Microsoft Exchange Server is running on the computer_device, company_name recommends excluding all Microsoft Exchange Server folders from scanning.
To exclude scanning of Microsoft Exchange server folders on a global basis, go to Preferences Global Settings Desktop/Server {tab} General Scan Settings, and then select Exclude Microsoft Exchange server folders when installed on Microsoft Exchange server.
Each time a file is opened, downloaded, copied, or modified, Real-time Scan in the trend_client_program_single scans the file for threats.
If you selected the 29th, 30th, or 31st day and a month does not have this day, the trend_client_program_single runs Scheduled Scan on the last day of the month.

Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
For agents running Windows Windows Server 2008:
Data Loss Prevention monitors email transmitted through various email clients.
Data Loss Prevention checks the email subject, body, and attachments for data identifiers.
If the email contains data identifiers, Data Loss Prevention will either allow or block the email.
Non-monitored email domains: Data Loss Prevention immediately allows the transmission of emails sent to non-monitored domains.
The only difference is that for non-monitored email domains, Data Loss Prevention does not log the transmission, whereas for monitored email subdomains, the transmission is always logged.
Monitored email subdomains: When Data Loss Prevention detects email transmitted to a monitored subdomain, it checks the action for the policy.
For email messages sent through the SMTP protocol, Data Loss Prevention checks if the target SMTP server is on the following lists:
If the SMTP server is not on the monitored targets list, Data Loss Prevention checks the other lists.
For emails sent through other protocols, Data Loss Prevention only checks the following lists:
Data Loss Prevention can monitor data transmission through the following network channels:

The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) helps identify patterns in network packets that may indicate an attack on the endpoint.
The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can help prevent the following well-known intrusions:
A Denial of Service attack where a hacker directs an oversized TCP/UDP packet at a target endpoint.
A Denial of Service attack where a hacker directs an oversized ICMP/ICMPv6 packet at a target endpoint.
A type of attack where a hacker sends an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) request with the same source and destination IP address to a targeted endpoint.
The target endpoint continually sends an ARP response (its MAC address) to itself, causing the endpoint to freeze or crash.
A Denial of Service attack where a program sends multiple TCP synchronization (SYN) packets to the endpoint, causing the endpoint to continually send synchronization acknowledgment (SYN/ACK) responses.
Similar to a Teardrop attack, this Denial of Service attack sends overlapping TCP fragments to the endpoint.
A confusing offset value in the second or later IP fragment can cause the operating system on the receiving endpoint to crash when attempting to reassemble the fragments.
A Denial of Service attack that sends fragmented IGMP packets to a target endpoint, which cannot properly process the IGMP packets.

trend_client_program_plural can log and block all connections made between endpoints and addresses in the Global C&C IP list.
You can also log, but still allow access to, IP addresses configured in the User-defined Blocked IP List.
To allow trend_client_program_plural to attempt to clean connections made to C&C servers, enable the Clean suspicious connections when a C&C callback is detected setting.
trend_client_program_plural use GeneriClean to clean the malware threat and terminate the connection to the C&C server.
Suspicious objects are digital artifacts resulting from an analysis completed by Trend Micro Deep Discovery products or other sources.
product_short_name can synchronize suspicious objects and retrieve actions against these objects from a Control Manager 6.0 SP3 or later on-premises server (that is connected to Deep Discovery).
After subscribing to Control Manager, select the types of suspicious objects to monitor C&C callbacks or possible targeted attacks identified by agents on the network.
After you unsubscribe product_short_name from Deep Discovery Analyzer, it is not possible to re-subscribe.
product_short_name must subscribe to Control Manager that is connected to Deep Discovery to synchronize suspicious objects.
The following table outlines some considerations you should be aware of before switching the scan method that trend_client_program_plural use.
Switching a relatively small number of trend_client_program_plural at a time allows efficient use of the OfficeScan server and Smart Protection Server resources.
These servers can perform other critical tasks while trend_client_program_plural change scan methods.
Trend Micro recommends disabling "Update Now" on trend_client_program_plural during the conversion process.
Scan method is a granular setting that you can apply on the root, domain, or individual trend_client_program_single level.
Any trend_client_program_plural belonging to the domain that do not already use the scan method, switch to the new scan method.
Select one or more trend_client_program_plural from a domain and change the scan method.
Ensure that agents can connect to the OfficeScan server.
OfficeScan only notifies online agents to switch scan methods.
Also verify that the OfficeScan server has the latest components to ensure that trend_client_program_plural can download the correct patterns from the server.

Notes: This readme file was current as of the date above.
Register online with Trend Micro within 30 days of installation to continue downloading new pattern files and product updates from the Trend Micro website.
About OfficeScan
Trend Micro(TM) OfficeScan(TM) protects enterprise networks from malware, network viruses, web-based threats, spyware, and mixed threat attacks.
An integrated solution, OfficeScan consists of an agent program that resides at the endpoint and a server program that manages all agents.
The server, through the web-based management console, makes it easy to set coordinated security policies and deploy updates to every agent.
OfficeScan is powered by the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network, a next generation cloud-client infrastructure that delivers security that is smarter than conventional approaches.
OfficeScan includes the following new features and enhancements:
2.1 What's New in OfficeScan XG SP1
OfficeScan agents detect ransomware downloaded through supported cloud synchronization channels.
Custom proxy settings for OfficeScan agents use the Windows Internet Options settings.
OfficeScan supports the detection of Suspicious Domain Objects through integration with Control Manager.
The document set for the OfficeScan agent includes:
* Readme file - Contains a list of known issues and basic installation steps.
* Help - HTML files compiled in WebHelp format that provide "how to's", usage advice, and field-specific information.
The Help is accessible from the OfficeScan agent console.
* Knowledge Base - An online database of problem-solving and troubleshooting information.
The OfficeScan agent can be installed on endpoints running Microsoft Windows platforms.
The OfficeScan agent is also compatible with various third-party products.
The OfficeScan administrator in your organization is responsible for installing and upgrading OfficeScan.
If your OfficeScan administrator grants you the privileges to modify scan settings, you can specify how OfficeScan handles security risks on your endpoint.
To determine if you have the privileges to modify scan settings, open the OfficeScan agent console and check if the "Settings" menu is active.
* To open the console from the Start menu, select "Programs > Trend Micro OfficeScan Agent > OfficeScan Agent".
* To open the console from the system tray, right-click the OfficeScan icon and then select "Open OfficeScan Agent Console".
When an application that locks the Windows Service Control Manager (SCM) is launched, the OfficeScan agent cannot be installed or upgraded.
Before upgrading or installing OfficeScan, ensure that no SCM-locking application is running.
Installing OfficeScan agents to Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2 using a GUEST OS running on VMware Workstation 6.x and below may cause the system to stop responding.
This is because of compatibility issues with the Intel(TM) Network Adapter Driver.
The OfficeScan agent program name does not display in all languages.
If the OfficeScan server computer or an agent endpoint has not properly updated its root certificate(for example, the computer does not have an Internet connection), OfficeScan cannot verify the computer's digital signatures during Inter-Process Communication (IPC).
To solve this issue, you must manually update the root certificate or perform a Windows Update.
A Microsoft Hyper-V virtual machine might not be able to start if the host computer has OfficeScan agent installed.
This is because the OfficeScan agent and Hyper-V virtual machine accesses the same Hyper-V xml file and causes file access violation.
* Set exclusion folder for the virtual machine xml file located in C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Virtual Machine Manager\.
* Turn off file mapping scan by modifying the TmFilter/TmxpFilter registry value.
However, for Manual Scan, there is no option for disabling spyware/ grayware scan, which means that during Manual Scan, OfficeScan will always scan for spyware/grayware.
When OfficeScan is configured to scan mapped drives during Manual Scan, the mapped drive may not get scanned when scanning is initiated through Terminal Service agent.
When an email containing an attachment with spyware/grayware is retrieved through Eudora email agent and POP3 Mail Scan is disabled, OfficeScan's Real-time Scan denies access to the email even if the scan action is "clean".
The email does not appear on the inbox and the Eudora agent displays a message informing the user that access to the email is denied.
In a Citrix environment, when the OfficeScan agent detects a security risk during a particular user session, the notification message for the security risk displays on all active user sessions.
* Virus/Malware
* Spyware/Grayware
* Firewall policy violation
* Web Reputation policy violation
* Unauthorized access to external devices
After updating the agent program, the "Prompt users before executing newly encountered programs downloaded through web or email applications (Server platforms excluded)" setting does not take effect until the agent program or endpoint is restarted.
OfficeScan agents with agent-level settings can only download settings from the OfficeScan server, not Update Agents.
An Update Agent running a 64-bit platform is unable to generate incremental patterns.
Select the "Show icon and notifications" option to display the OfficeScan icon in the Windows 7 and 8 system tray.
The default option for Windows 7 and 8 is "Only show notification".
Some agent console screens include a Help button, which, when clicked, opens context-sensitive, HTML-based Help.
Because Windows Server Core 2008 lacks a browser, the Help will not be available to the user.
Data transmitted through Instant Messaging applications are not detected if the applications use a non-transparent proxy server.
For Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 platforms, incoming packets to a computer on a VMware agent are dropped if the endpoint has the OfficeScan agent installed.
a. On the agent computer, open Registry Editor.
b. Add the following registry value:
for x64 computers:
c. Reload the agent for settings to take effect.
Agents can browse blocked sites if using Juniper Networks VPN and proxy servers to connect to the Internet.
a. Connect to the network using Juniper Networks VPN.
b. Open Internet Option > Connection > LAN Settings.
c. Disable Automatic configuration settings.
d. Enable Proxy server and specify the IP address and port of your proxy server.
e. Click Ok.
If users access the Internet using Firefox and a proxy server, be sure that proxy settings in Internet Explorer have been configured.
If proxy settings have not been configured in Internet Explorer, Web Reputation will not work, even if proxy settings have been configured in Firefox.
Due to the blocking of add-ons in Internet Explorer 10, HTTPS scanning only supports Windows 8, 10, or Windows 2012, 2016 platforms operating in desktop mode.
OfficeScan does not provide support of the Windows 8.1 pre- installed OneDrive (SkyDrive) synchronization folder.
OfficeScan logs malware infections for OneDrive (SkyDrive) as being in the "Local or network drive" channel.
If you disable the Unauthorized Change Prevention Service, the OfficeScan agent may lock files during the sychronization process and prevent the files from synchronizing to the sync folder.
OfficeScan logs malicious files that do not include a portable executable extension as being in the "Local or network drive" channel.
OfficeScan logs malicious files synchronized to mounted drives as being in the "Local or network drive" channel.

When the OfficeScan server is installed to a disk using the FAT32 file system, role-based logon to the OfficeScan web console does not work.
During upgrade, if the existing OfficeScan database file (found in the "HTTPDB" folder under "OfficeScan/PCCSRV") is very large, the upgrade process may time out.
From the OfficeScan console, manually delete old server logs.
Trend Micro Mobile Security is a standalone program and has no longer been supported as a plug-in program since OfficeScan 11.0.
To continue using Mobile Security, Trend Micro recommends upgrading to the standalone version 9.0.
For detailed migration steps, see
During OfficeScan server installation, the "pre-scan" feature is unable to detect double-byte malware threats.
The web console Dashboard displays a "500 Internal Server Error" if Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable Package (x86) is not installed.
To resolve this issue, install Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable Package (x86) and restart the IIS service.
After upgrading the OfficeScan server to XG, The Dashboard screen displays the following messages:
Go to Internet Explorer Tools > Internet options > General (tab).
Click OK to save the Temporary Internet Files and History Settings.
Click OK to save the Internet Explorer options settings.
When transferring the OfficeScan database to a SQL database installed on a Domain Controller endpoint, you must select the “Migrate the OfficeScan database to an existing SQL Server” option on the SQL Migration Tool (SQLTool.exe).
If you want to install a new SQL Server 2016 SP1 Express on a Domain Controller endpoint, you must follow the Microsoft Knowledge Base information on how to install SQL Server 2016 SP1 Express manually.
The ServerProtect Normal Server Migration tool is unable to:
Detect ServerProtect for Windows 5.8 with patch 7 or later
Restart the target endpoint after installing the OfficeScan agent even if the "Restart after installation" option is selected
Path: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\TrendMicro\ServerProtect\CurrentVersion\RPC
Name: AgentFilter
Value: IP addresses or endpoint name of the OfficeScan server
Microsoft IIS 7 does not work when installing the OfficeScan agent to a Windows Server 2008 endpoint with Microsoft IIS 7.
All applications using IIS do not work.:
A message displays on the endpoint using Windows Server 2008 without Service Pack 2, instructing the user to restart the IIS service to resolve the issue.
The OfficeScan agent may not install correctly if Norton SystemWorks antivirus is installed on the endpoint.
Uninstall it before installing OfficeScan agent.
If the OfficeScan agent is installed using the "per-user" method, the OfficeScan agent shortcut will still show on all the users' Windows Start menu.
After an OfficeScan agent in a VPN environment is uninstalled successfully, the agent is not removed on the web console's agent tree and its status is offline.
The administrator will not be able to remotely install the OfficeScan agent to Windows 7 x86 platforms without enabling the default administrator account.
Note: Enable the Remote Registry service on the Windows 7 machine.
By default, Windows 7 machines disable this feature.
Option A: Use the domain administrator account to remotely install OfficeScan XG agents to Windows 7 machines.
Option B: Use the default administrator account:
Type the "net user administrator /active:yes" command from the command console to enable the default administrator account.
Use the default administrator account to remotely install the OfficeScan agent to the Windows 7 machine.
This is because of compatibility issues with the Intel Network Adapter Driver.
Upgrade may fail if using an MSI package to upgrade an OfficeScan agent that was originally installed also using an MSI package.
Ensure that the new MSI package has the same file name as the original package.
If you do not know the file name of the original MSI package, check the following registry key: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Installer\Products\F4D73DF48B1EA594592F1CD021C5A1C9\SourceList\PackageName
Install the new MSI package.
Use command prompt to execute the package with the parameter "/fvo".
For example, msiexec /fvo c:\temp\package.msi.
If you add the OfficeScan agent program to the Microsoft Software Restriction Policy list using the user interface, you may need to restart the endpoint before subsequent additions to the list take effect.
After rolling back a component on an OfficeScan agent, the Component Update Details screen displays "n/a" under the Notification Sent and Notification Received columns.
A Microsoft Hyper-V virtual machine might not be able to start if the host endpoint has OfficeScan agent installed.
This is because the OfficeScan agent and Hyper-V virtual machine access the same Hyper-V xml file, which causes file access violation.
Set exclusion folder for the virtual machine xml file located in C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Virtual Machine Manager\.
Turn off file mapping scan by modifying the TmFilter/TmxpFilter registry value.
On the server computer, open ofcscan.ini under the \PCCSRV folder.
Modify the following setting under [Global Setting]: UseMapping=0
On the web console, go to Agents > Global Agent Settings and click Save to deploy the setting to all agents.
However, for Manual Scan, there is no option for disabling spyware/grayware scan, which means that during Manual Scan, OfficeScan will always scan for spyware/grayware.
When OfficeScan is configured to scan mapped drives during Manual Scan, the mapped drive may not get scanned when scanning is initiated through Terminal Service client.
When an email containing an attachment with spyware/grayware is retrieved through Eudora email client and POP3 Mail Scan is disabled, OfficeScan's Real-time Scan denies access to the email even if the scan action is "clean".
The email does not appear on the inbox and the Eudora client displays a message informing the user that access to the email is denied.
When updating OfficeScan patterns and engines from Control Manager, administrators are not notified of the update status even if notifications are enabled.
The update status can be viewed from the Control Manager console.
The Active Directory scope may display as empty or redirect to the Active Directory integration screen when querying Outside Server Management reports with a broad scope.
For Menu Items for Managed Domains, when an Active Directory user is part of several Active Directory groups, the user combines domain permissions but applies the higher role setting on all applicable domains.
When the endpoint's date/time format is changed, the date/time format on the OfficeScan console does not automatically change.
Users are unable to collapse the agent management tree menu items on the User Account - Step 3 Define Agent Tree Menu screen when configuring User Accounts on Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 platforms running Internet Explorer 11.
Install the Internet Explorer 11 hotfix from the Microsoft Windows Update site:
After expanding the menu items when creating or modifying a User Role or User Account, you cannot collapse the menu items again in Internet Explorer 11.
To resolve this issue for 32-bit platforms, install the following Internet Explorer security update:
Agent names in the OfficeScan agent tree supports only 15 characters and truncates the succeeding characters.
If the agent security level configured on the web console is set to "High", connection through Nortel VPN client cannot be established.
Select the Show icon and notifications option to display the OfficeScan icon in the Windows 7 and 8 system tray.
The default option for Windows 7 and 8 is Only show notification.
On the web console's Update Summary screen (Updates > Summary), the Behavior Monitoring Configuration Pattern, Policy Enforcement Pattern, and Digital Signature Pattern do not appear correctly due to JavaScript caching.
If the Device Control permission for USB storage devices is changed from "Allow" to "Block" when USB storage device files are already opened on the agent endpoint, access to the opened files is still permitted.
The Block permission is updated the next time that the USB device is plugged in, or the agent endpoint is restarted.
Device management applications (such as iTunes, HTCSync, and SamSung Kies) for devices blocked by Device Control are also blocked from user access.
Data Loss Prevention logs can only display the first 1000 bytes of characters in the Source and Destination columns due to a buffer overflow issue with long file names.
The Firewall rule for outgoing traffic will not work as expected if a machine has several IP addresses with different Firewall policies.
When the security level on a Citrix server is medium or high, perform the following steps:
On the OfficeScan server web console, create a new firewall policy.
For Windows Server 2003 platforms hosting VMware agents, incoming packets to a VMware agent endpoint are dropped if the host machine has the OfficeScan agent installed.
Add the following setting under [Global Setting]: EnableGlobalPfwBypassRule=1
For x64 endpoints: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432\TrendMicro\PC-cillinNTCorp\CurrentVersion\PFW
The OfficeScan firewall service and driver cannot be installed if a previous version of the firewall driver exists and is running but there is no Trend Micro Common Firewall in the network protocol.
Only Internet Explorer is supported for configuring proxy settings used by agents to connect to the Global Smart Protection Server.
If proxy settings are configured in other browsers, agents will not be able to connect to the Global Smart Protection Server.
If you enable the option Check HTTPS URLs in a Web Reputation policy:
Select the option Enable third-party browser extensions in Internet Explorer.
If this option is disabled, agents will not be able to check the reputation of HTTPS websites.
For agents running Windows Server 2008 (32-bit), disable Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration (IE ESC) from Windows Server Manager.
If IE ESC is enabled, the Web Reputation blocking page displays in source code mode.
Connect to the network using Juniper Networks VPN.
Open Internet Option > Connection > LAN Settings.
Enable Proxy server and specify the IP address and port of your proxy server.
On the OfficeScan agent endpoint, Web Reputation automatic proxy	detection in Internet Explorer does not work if the administrator enables the OfficeScan Agent Access Restriction option on the OfficeScan server web console's Privileges and Other Settings screen.
Note: OfficeScan begins updating the Web Blocking List immediately after the server upgrades.
If the OfficeScan agent is unable to connect to the integrated Smart Protection Server source on Windows Vista and Windows Server 2003/2008, the agent cannot block suspicious URL objects.
If another user logs onto an endpoint before a Predictive Machine Learning query result completes, OfficeScan logs the newly logged on user as the event owner when the query returns.
OfficeScan does not provide support of the Windows 8.1 pre-installed OneDrive (SkyDrive) synchronization folder.
The Integrated Windows Authentication protocol is not supported when registering OfficeScan to Control Manager and specifying web server authentication credentials for the IIS server.
The Online Help system experiences scripting errors when viewed using Internet Explorer 8.0 and earlier.
Apply the following Windows fix to solve the problem:
Windows 2003 virtual platforms cannot connect to vCenter 5.x or later using SSL connections (port 443 with HTTPS).
Windows 2012 virtual platforms cannot connect to XenServer 5.x using SSL connections (port 443 with HTTPS).

Network Traffic for Upgrading OfficeScan Agents
Estimated size (in terms of bandwidth) of upgrading each OfficeScan agent:
For each OfficeScan agent running on a 32-bit endpoint = 104 MB
OfficeScan Agent Post-Upgrade Requirements
After upgrading OfficeScan agents to OfficeScan XG Service Pack 1, you must restart the agent endpoints to ensure that the OfficeScan agent program properly adopts the HTTPS module and continues to properly communicate with the OfficeScan server.
Before moving OfficeScan agents from an existing OfficeScan XG server, you must install OfficeScan XG Critical Patch 1737 on the source OfficeScan server to ensure that the OfficeScan agents can properly report to the target OfficeScan XG Service Pack 1 server.
Note: If you are upgrading the OfficeScan XG server to OfficeScan XG Service Pack 1 directly, you do not need to apply the Critical Patch.
Structural Conref - Installing the OfficeScan Server

When in assessment mode, all OfficeScan agents managed by the server log spyware/grayware detected during Manual Scan, Scheduled Scan, Real-Time Scan, and Scan Now but do not clean spyware/grayware components.
Before the OfficeScan server installation commences, Setup can scan the target endpoint for viruses and malware.
The web server listens for OfficeScan agent requests on the HTTP port and forwards these requests to the OfficeScan Master Service.
This service returns information to OfficeScan agents at the designated OfficeScan agent communication port.
Setup randomly generates the OfficeScan agent communication port number during installation.

The integrated server provides File Reputation Services to OfficeScan agents that use smart scan and Web Reputation Services to OfficeScan agents subject to web reputation policies.
Manage the integrated server from the OfficeScan web console.
company_name recommends installing the standalone Smart Protection Server, which has the same functions as the integrated server but can serve more OfficeScan agents.
Because the integrated Smart Protection Server and the OfficeScan server run on the same endpoint, the endpoint's performance may reduce significantly during peak traffic for the two servers.
To reduce the traffic directed to the OfficeScan server computer, assign a standalone Smart Protection Server as the primary smart protection source and the integrated server as a backup source.
See the Administrator's Guide for information on configuring smart protection sources for OfficeScan agents.
Choose to install the OfficeScan agent on the target server.
The OfficeScan agent program provides the actual protection against security risks.
Therefore, to protect the OfficeScan server endpoint against security risks, it needs to also have the OfficeScan agent program.
Choosing to install the OfficeScan agent during server installation is a convenient way to ensure that the server is automatically protected.
It also removes the additional task of installing the OfficeScan agent after server installation.
Install the OfficeScan agent to other endpoints on the network after server installation.
See the Administrator's Guide for the OfficeScan agent installation methods.
If a company_name or third-party endpoint security software is currently installed on the server computer, OfficeScan may not be able to automatically uninstall the software and replace it with the OfficeScan agent.
Contact your support provider for a list of software that OfficeScan automatically uninstalls.
If the software cannot be uninstalled automatically, manually uninstall it before proceeding with OfficeScan installation.
Administrators can launch the web console to start configuring OfficeScan settings.
When enabling web reputation policies in a separate installation screen (for details, see ), OfficeScan agents cannot send web reputation queries because OfficeScan assumes that no Smart Protection Server installation occurred.
If a standalone server is available after installing OfficeScan, perform the following tasks from the OfficeScan web console:
Add the standalone server to the smart protection source list so that OfficeScan agents can send file and web reputation queries to the server.
If the server manages IPv4 and IPv6 OfficeScan agents, it must have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and administrators must identify the server by its host name.
If administrators identify the server by its IPv4 address, IPv6 OfficeScan agents cannot connect to the server.
The same issue occurs if pure IPv4 OfficeScan agents connect to a server identified by its IPv6 address.
If the server manages only IPv6 OfficeScan agents, the minimum requirement is an IPv6 address.
OfficeScan agents can connect to the integrated Smart Protection Server's File Reputation Services using HTTP and HTTPS.
The port numbers used for File Reputation Services depend on the web server the OfficeScan server uses.
There are several methods for installing OfficeScan agents.
Use this screen to estimate the size required on the servers and the bandwidth consumption when deploying OfficeScan agents to the target endpoints.
Accept the default OfficeScan agent installation settings or specify a different OfficeScan agent installation path.
If the specified path includes a directory that does not exist on the endpoint, Setup creates the directory automatically during OfficeScan agent installation.
To type a static OfficeScan agent installation path, type the drive path, including the drive letter.
Modification of the OfficeScan agent installation path is not possible after installation of the OfficeScan server completes.
All installed OfficeScan agents use the same installation path.
When specifying variables for the OfficeScan agent installation path, use the following:
$BOOTDISK: The drive letter of the hard disk that the endpoint boots from, by default C:\
Port number: Setup randomly generates this port number, which the OfficeScan server uses to communicate with OfficeScan agents.
Security level: After installing OfficeScan, change the security level from the OfficeScan console.
Normal: This permission grants all users (the user group Everyone) full rights to the OfficeScan agent program directory and OfficeScan agent registry entries.
High: The OfficeScan agent installation directory inherits the rights of the Program Files folder and the OfficeScan agent registry entries inherit permissions from the HKLM\Software key.

Specify the OfficeScan Database name on the SQL Server.
The OfficeScan Firewall protects OfficeScan agents and servers on the network using stateful inspections, high performance network virus scans, and elimination.
Optionally choose to disable the Firewall and enable it later from the OfficeScan server web console.
When upgrading and the Firewall service is already enabled on server platforms, select Enable firewall on server platforms so that OfficeScan does not disable the Firewall service after the upgrade.
OfficeScan Managed Detection and Response Installation
This section outlines the requirements for installing the OfficeScan server and OfficeScan agents and the instructions necessary to install the OfficeScan server.
The following table outlines the system requirements for the OfficeScan XG MDR Server.
For more information about SQL Server requirements, see .
Windows Server 2016 64-bit (Standard)
Windows Server 2016 64-bit (Datacenter)

Visual C++
SQL Server 2016
SQL Server 2016 Express SP1
Installing the OfficeScan Server
When installing the OfficeScan server on a pure IPv6 endpoint, set up a dual-stack proxy server that can convert between IP addresses.
The OfficeScan server uses the HTTP protocol for agent-server communication and to connect to the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server and download updates.
If a proxy server handles Internet traffic on the network, OfficeScan needs the proxy settings to ensure that the server can download updates from the ActiveUpdate server.
Administrators can skip specifying proxy settings during installation and do so after installation from the OfficeScan web console.
If a preexisting certificate exists, OfficeScan automatically maps the file on the Server Authentication Certificate screen.
If no preexisting certificate exists, OfficeScan defaults to the Generate a new authentication certificate option.
OfficeScan uses public-key cryptography to authenticate communications that the OfficeScan server initiates on OfficeScan agents.
With public-key cryptography, the server keeps a private key and deploys a public key to all OfficeScan agents.
The OfficeScan agents use the public key to verify that incoming communications are server-initiated and valid.
The OfficeScan agents respond if the verification is successful.
OfficeScan does not authenticate communications that OfficeScan agents initiate on the server.
OfficeScan can generate the authentication certificate during the installation or administrators can import a preexisting authentication certificate from another OfficeScan server.
Specify if OfficeScan agents identify the server computer by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN), host (domain) name, or IP address.
Communication between the server computer and OfficeScan agents is dependent on the specified IP address.
Changing the IP address results in OfficeScan agents not being able to communicate with the OfficeScan server.
The only way to restore communication is to redeploy all the OfficeScan agents.
In most networks, the server computer's IP address is more likely to change than its host name, thus it is usually preferable to identify the server computer by a host name.
Administrators can avoid further communication issues with OfficeScan agents by setting the IP address configuration to Static (on the DHCP server) using the same IP address information obtained from the DHCP server.
Another way to preserve the IP address configuration is to reserve the IP address for the OfficeScan server only.
This forces the DHCP server to assign OfficeScan the same IP address even when DHCP-enabled.
In addition, if the server computer has multiple network interface cards (NICs), consider using one of the IP addresses instead of the host name to ensure successful agent-server communication.
You do not need to participate in Smart Feedback to protect your endpoints.
Trend Micro recommends installing a standalone SQL Server 2016 Standard SP1 server to manage the large amount of data generated by MDR OfficeScan agents.
The following table outlines the recommended system requirements for the SQL Server 2016 Standard SP1 server.
SQL Server 2016 Standard SP1
500GB: Recommended for storing up to 3 months of data
1.5TB: Recommended for storing up to 1 year of data
OfficeScan uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for secure communication between the web console and the server.
Although OfficeScan encrypts the passwords specified on the web console before sending them to the OfficeScan server, hackers can still sniff the packet and, without decrypting the packet, "replay" it to gain access to the console.
Web Reputation policies dictate whether OfficeScan blocks or allows access to a website.
Selecting Enable web reputation policy enables policies for internal and external OfficeScan agents installed on desktop platforms, such as Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1.
OfficeScan agents use the location criteria configured in the web console's Endpoint Location screen to determine their location and the policy to apply.
OfficeScan agents switch policies each time the location changes.
Configure web reputation policy settings from the web console after installation.
OfficeScan administrators typically configure a stricter policy for external OfficeScan agents.
Web reputation policies are granular settings in the OfficeScan agent tree.
Enforce specific policies to all OfficeScan agents, OfficeScan agent groups, or individual OfficeScan agents.
When enabling web reputation policies, be sure to install Smart Protection Servers (integrated or standalone) and add them to the smart protection source list on the OfficeScan web console.
OfficeScan agents send web reputation queries to the servers to verify the safety of websites that users are accessing.
The integrated server installs with the OfficeScan server.
Port Numbers for the OfficeScan Web Server
The OfficeScan web server hosts the web console, allows the administrator to run console Common Gateway Interfaces (CGIs), and accepts commands from OfficeScan agents.
The web server converts these commands to OfficeScan agent CGIs and forwards them to the OfficeScan Master Service.

Clean Spyware/Grayware|When cleaning spyware/grayware, the possible actions that could be taken are:Delete registries, delete files, kill processes, delete cookies, and delete shortcuts.
Unauthorized Change Prevention Service|Regulates application behavior and verifies program trustworthiness. Behavior Monitoring, Device Control, Application Control, Security Agent Self-Protection, and HTTPS Web Threat Protection all require this service.This setting is predefined in the following groups:Device (Default): Desktops onlyServer (Default): Desktops and servers
Exclude the Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 folders|If you enable this option, the following Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 folders are automatically excluded from scans:- .ExchsrvrMailrootvsi (Queue, Pickup, and BadMail)- .Exchsrvrmdbdata- .ExchsrvrStorage GroupFor more details, see the Online Help.
Scan for Cookies|The Security Agent will scan for cookies when this option is selected. After this option selected, Security Agent will treat cookies as spyware and increment the spyware counter by one each time it detects a cookie.
HTTPS Web Threat Protection|This feature does not require an additional browser add-on.By default, Worry-Free Business Security Services checks HTTPS URLs on Firefox and Internet Explorer using browser add-ons.
|To verify the certificate information, go to the Apple Push Certificates Portal and click the information icon for the certificate.
Domain|Selecting the Domain group will automatically add devices to the Active Directory domain in the Device Tree. If a device is not registered to the Active Directory server, it will be added to the Default group instead.
Process Termination|After terminating the process, Worry-Free Business Security Services attempts to clean or quarantine the file and threat remnants from the endpoint.
Auto Backup and Restore|Automatically backing up files before suspicious programs attempt any modification enables easier file restoration when unauthorized encryption occurs. Enabling this feature requires an additional storage space of 100MB.
Program Inspection|Program inspection monitors processes and performs API hooking to determine if a program is behaving in an unexpected manner. Although this procedure increases the overall detection ratio of compromised executable files, it may result in decreased system performance.

If you make changes to the Active Directory structure, you must export and re-import the structure into the Worry-Free Business Security Services web console.
Worry-Free Business Security Services now supports Active Directory integration using the Trend Micro Common Active Directory Synchronization Tool. To enable Active Directory integration, you must remove the imported Active Directory structure.
Worry-Free Business Security Services only scans for critical Windows security vulnerabilities that were exploited by malware attacks. These exploited vulnerabilities caused a massive security impact on Windows endpoints and were resolved by Microsoft security updates. Trend Micro recommends regularly applying the latest Microsoft security updates to keep your endpoints protected.

In the CSV file, specify the tag information in the format [IP address],[user name],[department] and separate the entries using line breaks.
If a CSV file contains multiple entries with the same IP address, only the first entry is imported into the system.
If you import a new CSV file, the system overwrites existing tag entries.
To import a CSV file, do the following steps:
Click Browse and select the CSV file.
Specify the IP address and the host name, or both fields and click Apply.
If you set the Host name field, the web console displays the scan results of endpoints whose names contain the specified text.
Click in the Action column.
After a scan is complete, the assessment tool generates and sends scan reports to the product_name server.
For easy endpoint identification, product_name supports endpoint tagging by matching tag information from an imported CSV file with endpoints and displaying the tag information on the web console.
Using the web console, administrators can send selected scan reports to one or more email recipients or download scan reports to a local endpoint.
The File Distribution Information screen shows the time a detected file is stored on endpoints and the IP addresses of the endpoints on which the file is found.

For Worry-Free Business Security and Worry-Free Business Security Services events:
product_short_name events vary for each managed product/service.
What differences exist for Licensing Management Platform accounts and Customer Licensing Portal accounts in product_short_name?
The following table outlines the functionality differences in product_short_name when using different account types.
Licensing Management Platform Account
Customer Licensing Portal Account
Customer management - Deleting customers
Product management - Deleting products
Product description - Editing

How do I add new products to existing product_short_name customer accounts?
Depending on the type of Trend Micro Account you are using, the method of adding products to existing product_short_name customer accounts varies.
Licensing Management Platform accounts: You can add new products to existing product_short_name customer accounts directly from the product_short_name web console.
Online Registration portal accounts: You can only add Worry-Free Business Security, Worry-Free Business Security Services, and Hosted Email Security products to existing product_short_name customers by receiving an Authorization Key for the managed product and registering the product from the managed product console.
After creating a new customer in Licensing Management platform, why does the customer not display in product_short_name?
How long do changes to my Customer Licensing Portal account take to appear on the MyAccount screen?
After making changes to your Customer Licensing Portal account information, the system can take up to 2 hours to synchronize the changes with the product_short_name web console.
Does product_short_name support role-based administration?
No. product_short_name only supports the use of a fully-functional administrator account.
How do I access a managed product console from product_short_name?
On the product_short_name web console, go to Customers [customer] Products and click a product name in the tree view.
Why does the product_short_name console not display an updated status right after updating settings?
Why do I receive a sign-in error when trying to open the Worry-Free Business Security Services console?
This happens if Worry-Free Business Security Services is down for maintenance or if there is an issue with Licensing Management Platform.
The following sections outline common questions regarding product_short_name configurations:
product_name offers the following features.
product_short_name Features
product_short_name works in parallel with Trend Micro Licensing Management Platform, but with a more robust interface.
You can do the following from the product_short_name portal:
product_short_name also monitors and manages multiple protected networks from a single console by communicating with a product_short_name Agent that runs on the managed servers.
In addition, product_short_name also offers event monitoring based on key security indicators.
Dashboard Widgets
Customize the widgets on the dashboard page.
These widgets can let you know if you need to renew licenses, add more allocated seats, or even let you know which customers experience the most threats.
product_short_name provides details such as the number of infected computers and virus/malware incidents.
Reseller administrators can check the system-related event information such as component update status, device resource usage, and online status on the product_short_name Events screen:
product_short_name offers a structured view of managed networks and allows reseller administrators to issue commands and manage the following critical aspects of network security:
In addition to notifications for security events, product_short_name can automatically generate and send reports at regular intervals.
Enable log monitoring using third-party tools, including Autotask, Kaseya, or ConnectWise to standardize the tasks and processes you monitor.
And to this end, product_short_name welcomes your feedback and suggestions through the Submit Feedback button, which is accessible and visible from the banner.
For example, selecting Products Hosted Email Security (HES) and System Events Cloud email scanning returns all Hosted Email Security (HES) events and all "Cloud email scanning" events for any product.
(Optional) Click Export to generate a CSV file of your filtered customers.

Hosted Email Security FAQs
Why is the latest 3 hours data not displayed on Live Status?
On the Hosted Email Security server, data collection takes places over a two-hour period.
To be certain that the product_short_name server will have integrated data from the Hosted Email Security server, data collection is delayed for 3 hours.
Why are Sync with Server and Go to Customer Console grayed out when right-clicking on Hosted Email Security on the customer tree?
There are three possible reasons for Hosted Email Security is not being active.
Hosted Email Security hasn't yet been connected to product_short_name.
Why do I get the error message "Your Hosted Email Security customer has not connected to product_short_name or has been disconnected by Hosted Email Security.
Contact your administrator" when I try to redirect to the customer's Hosted Email Security console after the customer connected Hosted Email Security to product_short_name?
After entering the GUID or Authorization Key and clicking Connect, it can take as long as ten minutes for Hosted Email Security to complete the connection to the product_short_name web console.
Why does an Hosted Email Security customer's Activation Code (AC) and Expiration Date show "N/A" on the product_short_name web console?
If a Hosted Email Security customer has not connected the Hosted Email Security service to product_short_name or has disconnected, product_short_name cannot retrieve data.
The other reason is that Hosted Email Security cannot find a valid Activation Code and Expiration Date for this customer.

The dashboard shows the following InterScan Web Security as a Service widgets:
Therefore, with our expert cloud technology, we have created an elastic cloud-security gateway product—InterScan Web Security as a Service (IWSaaS).
By using IWSaaS, you can focus on strategic security, such as policy and architecture, rather than on the operational tasks of managing network infrastructure.
In addition, IWSaaS scans for many types of spyware, grayware, and other risk types.
Block websites determined by Web Reputation Service (WRS) to be malicious, based on a website’s reputation score.
Control Internet applications discovered by Application Control using policies.
Scan traffic organized by URL categories, such as “Adult” and “Gambling”.
When a user requests a URL, IWSaaS, using URL Filtering policies, first looks up the category for that URL and then allows, denies, or monitors access based on the policies set up.
Monitor and analyze web traffic status using the dashboard reporting and log query feature.
How IWSaaS Works
The diagram below illustrates how IWSaaS manages your network traffic in the cloud.
When a user sends an HTTP request - whether inside or outside your firewall - that user's traffic is routed through the cloud.
IWSaaS inspects the request, analyzes it, and filters it based on policies set by administrators.
If the request is allowed, and the user logs onto IWSaaS, then IWSaaS sends the secure content back to the user.
If the request is not allowed, for example a request to a forbidden URL category, then IWSaaS blocks the request and notifies the user.
You can access the table of content-type Help—the Help Contents from the Help menu located in the main banner, along with the readme, Getting Started instructions, and Getting Start Guide.

Remote Manager overall architecture
The partner accesses a company_name Data Center (currently on different continents) through the product_short_name web console via the Internet.
The partner must add and configure each customer on the product_short_name web console before the partner can manage customer accounts.
Each Worry-Free Business Security Standard and Advanced managed server has a product_short_name Agent installed which allows communication to and from the product_short_name servers.
The product_short_name Agent, which can be installed from the product_short_name web console, runs on the Worry-Free Business Security Standard and Advanced managed server inside the customer’s network.
The product_short_name Agent sends information to the product_short_name server where you can access the data from your console 24/7 using an Internet connection.
Worry-Free Business Security Services (WFBS-SVC) and Hosted Email Security (HES) are both hosted on the company_name Data Center.
InterScan Web Security as a Service (IWSaaS), Cloud App Security (CAS), and Cloud Edge (CE) are all hosted on the cloud.
WFBS-SVC, HES, IWSaaS, CAS, and CE all send data directly to the product_short_name server.

A pure IPv6 agent cannot obtain updates directly from a pure IPv4 Security Server/Update Agent and the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server.
In these situations, a dual-stack proxy server that can convert IP addresses, such as DeleGate, is required to allow the agent to obtain updates.
The product_short_name agents are:
product_short_name Agents
Messaging Security Agent (Advanced only)
To provide the Security Server with the very latest client information, the agent sends event status information in real time.
For example: Spammers often use many exclamation marks or more than one consecutive exclamation mark(!!!!) in their email messages.
When the Messaging Security Agent detects a message that uses exclamation marks this way, it increases the spam score for that email message.
Users cannot modify the method that the anti-spam engine uses to assign spam scores, but they can adjust the detection levels used by the Messaging Security Agent to decide what is spam and what is not spam.
Microsoft Outlook may automatically filter and send messages that the Messaging Security Agent detected as spam to the Junk Mail folder.
The Messaging Security Agent does not filter messages arriving from these addresses for spam except when Detect Phishing incidents is enabled.
The Microsoft Exchange Administrator’s Approved Senders list and Blocked Senders list (on the Anti-spam screen) control how the Messaging Security Agent handles email messages bound for the Microsoft Exchange server.
Approved and Blocked Senders lists on a Microsoft Exchange server override the Approved and Blocked Senders lists on a client.
For example, the sender “user@example.com” is on the Administrator’s Blocked Senders list, but the end-user has added that address to his Approved Senders list.
Messages from that sender arrive at the Microsoft Exchange store and the Messaging Security Agent detects them as spam and takes action against them.
When you are using Outlook, there is a size limit for the amount and size of addresses on the list.
To prevent a system error, the Messaging Security Agent limits the amount of addresses that an end user can include in his or her approved sender list (this limit is calculated according to the length and the number of email addresses).
When the option Customize approved/blocked URLs for this group is selected, the Security Agent uses the group's customized list of approved or blocked URLs to control access to websites.
Configure the Messaging Security Agent to block attachments according to the attachment type or attachment name and then replace, quarantine, or delete all the messages that have attachments that match the criteria.
However, the Messaging Security Agent examines the file header rather than the file name to ascertain the actual file type.
By configuring the Messaging Security Agent to block according to file type, you can decrease the security risk to your Microsoft Exchange servers from those types of files.

Disable hot fix deployment
Deploying hot fixes, patches, security/critical patches, and service packs to a large number of agents simultaneously can significantly increase network traffic.
Enabling this option also disables automatic build upgrades on agents (for example, from the Beta build to the release build of the current product version) but NOT automatic version upgrades (for example, from version 7.x to the current version).
The Messaging Security Agent detects spam messages in real time and takes actions to protect the Microsoft Exchange Servers.
Select the Target tab to select the method and spam detection rate that the Messaging Security Agent uses to screen for spam:
The Messaging Security Agent monitors all email messages for suspicious files or text, but there is greater chance of false positives.
False positives are those email messages that the Messaging Security Agent filters as spam when they are actually legitimate email messages.
The Messaging Security Agent monitors at a high level of spam detection with a moderate chance of filtering false positives.
The Messaging Security Agent will only filter the most obvious and common spam messages, but there is a very low chance that it will filter false positives.
If an end-user creates an approved sender, but that sender is on the administrator's Blocked Senders list, then the Messaging Security Agent detects messages from that blocked sender as spam and takes action against those messages.
Click the Action tab to set the actions that the Messaging Security Agent takes when it detects a spam message or phishing incident.
For example, if no URLs are approved for a particular group, all the URLs approved on this screen will be applicable for the group.
The Security Agent automatically identifies the location of the client based on the gateway information configured on the web console, and then controls the websites users can access.
Gateway Information: Clients and connections in this list will use Internal Connection settings while remotely connecting to the network (using VPN) and Location Awareness is enabled.

Configuring Real-time Scan for Messaging Security Agents
Configuring Real-time Scan for Security Agents
If you enabled the option, the default scan method is smart scan, which means that all Security Agents will use smart scan.
Switch agents to conventional scan if you notice a drop in performance in the Security Server, which may signal that it is unable to handle all scan queries from agents in a timely manner.
Security Server connection
Also verify that the Security Server has the latest components because agents need to download new components from the Security Server, namely, Smart Scan Agent Pattern for agents that will switch to smart scan and Virus Pattern for agents that will switch to conventional scan.
Number of Security Agents to switch
When switching Security Agents for the first time, agents need to download the full version of the Smart Scan Agent Pattern (for agents that will switch to smart scan) or Virus Pattern (for agents that will switch to conventional scan).
A pure IPv6 smart scan agent that is offline cannot send queries directly to the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network.
A dual-stack proxy server that can convert IP addresses, such as DeleGate, is required to allow the smart scan agent to send queries.
For monthly Scheduled Scans, if you select 31, 30, or 29 days and a month has less than the number of days, the scan will not run that month.
Configuring Scheduled Updates for the Security Server
Choose between daily, weekly, and monthly updates, and then specify a value for Update for a period of, which is the number of hours during which the Security Server will perform the update.
For monthly scheduled updates (not recommended), if you select 31, 30, or 29 days and a month has less than the number of days, the update will not run that month.
Configuring SMTP Server Settings
When you enable the tool, a quarantine folder is created on the server-side of each client's mailbox and a Spam Mail folder appears in the end user's Outlook folder tree.
After EUQ is enabled and the Spam Mail folders are created, EUQ will filter spam mail to the user's Spam mail folder.
Clear Enable End User Quarantine tool to disable the end user quarantine tool for all mailboxes on your Microsoft Exchange server.
When you disable the EUQ tool, the users' Spam Mail folders will remain, but messages detected as spam will not be moved to the Spam Mail folders.
In Delete spam messages older than {number} days, modify the length of time that the Messaging Security Agent will retain spam messages.
Under End User Quarantine tool exception list, type the email address of the end user for whom you want to disable EUQ.
To remove an end user from the list and restore the EUQ service, select the end user’s email address from the list and click Delete.
Inactive Security Agent Removal
When you use the Security Agent uninstallation program on the client to remove the Agents from a client, the program automatically notifies the Security Server.
When the Security Server receives this notification, it removes the client icon from the Security Groups Tree to show that the client no longer exists.
However, if the Security Agent is removed using other methods, such as reformatting the computer’s hard drive or deleting the client files manually, the Security Server will be unaware of the removal and will display the Security Agent as inactive.
If a user unloads or disables the Agent for an extended time, the Security Server also displays the Security Agent as inactive.
To have the Security Groups Tree only display active clients, you can configure the Security Server to remove inactive Security Agents from the Security Groups Tree automatically.
Enable automatic removal of inactive Security Agent: Enables the automatic removal of clients that have not contacted the Security Server for the specified number of days.
Automatically remove a Security Agent if inactive for {} days: The number of days that a client is allowed to be inactive before it is removed from the web console.
If you need to change the directory (for example, if it has insufficient disk space), type an absolute path, such as D:\Quarantined Files, in the Quarantine Directory field.
If you do this, be sure to also apply the same changes in Security Settings {Group} Configure Quarantine or agents will continue sending the files to \PCCSRV\Virus.
Maximum size for a single file: The maximum size of a single file stored in the quarantine folder in MB.
If you do not want agents to send quarantined files to the Security Server, configure the new directory in Security Settings Configure Quarantine and ignore all the maintenance settings.
Security Agent Installation
Security Agent Installation directory: During installation, you are prompted to type the Security Agent installation directory, which is where Setup installs each Security Agent.
$WINDIR: The folder where Windows is installed
Configuring the Security Server Update Source
If the source is the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate Server, ensure that the Security Server has Internet connection and, if you are using a proxy server, test if Internet connection can be established using the proxy settings.
A pure IPv6 Security Server cannot update directly from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server or any pure IPv4 custom update source.
A dual-stack proxy server that can convert IP addresses, such as DeleGate, is required to allow the Security Server to connect to the update sources.
Also specify the logon credentials (user name and password) that the Security Server will use to connect to this source.
Example 1:C:\Windows\system32\regedit.exe
Example 2:D:\backup\tool.exe
Assign Security Agents as Update Agents
Back in the Assign Update Agent(s) section, select Update Agents always update directly from the Security Server only if you want Update Agents to always download updated components from the Security Server instead of another Update Agent.
Disabling this option prevents Security Agents from updating from Update Agents, effectively switching their update source back to the Security Server.
To specify a single Security Agent, enter the Security Agent’s IP address in both the from and to fields.
Define more IP ranges as necessary.
If you have defined several IP ranges, you can use the Reorder option to set the IP range priority.
When the Security Server notifies Security Agents that updates are available, they scan the IP Range list to identify their correct update source.
The Security Agent scans the first item on the list and continues down the list until it identifies its correct update source.
This means that if the Security Agents are unable to update from an Update Agent, they will try other Update Agents.
To do this, create at least two (2) entries with the same IP range and assign each entry a different Update Agent.
To remove an Update Agent and unassign all Security Agents assigned to it, go to the Assign Update Agent(s) section, select the check box corresponding to the Update Agent’s Computer Name, and click Remove.
This action will not remove the Security Agents’ IP address range in the Alternative Update Sources section and will only cause the “orphaned” Security Agents to switch their update source back to the Security Server.
Unassign Security Agents from Update Agents
If you no longer want Security Agents belonging to an IP address range to update from an Update Agent, go to the Alternative Update Sources section, select the check box corresponding to the Security Agents’ IP address range, and click Remove.

Email Reputation (Advanced only)
Trend Micro email reputation technology validates IP addresses by checking them against a reputation database of known spam sources and by using a dynamic service that can assess email sender reputation in real time.
Malicious emails are blocked in the cloud based on the sender's IP address, preventing threats such as zombies or botnets from reaching the network or the user's PC.
With Email Reputation enabled, all inbound SMTP traffic is checked by the IP databases to see whether the originating IP address is clean or has been black-listed as a known spam vector.
When an email message from a blocked or a suspected IP address is found, Email Reputation Services (ERS) stops it before it reaches your messaging infrastructure.
If ERS blocks email messages from an IP address you feel is safe, add that IP address to the Approved IP Address list.
With Email Reputation enabled, all inbound SMTP traffic is checked by the IP databases to see whether the originating IP address is clean or it has been listed as a known spam vector.
When an email message from a blocked or a suspected IP address is found, Email Reputation blocks the message before it reaches your gateway.
Fake Access Points (also known as Evil Twin) is a term for a rogue Wi-Fi access point that appears to be a legitimate one offered on the premises, but actually has been set up by a hacker to eavesdrop on wireless communications.
Agents that are not in smart scan mode do not use File Reputation Services and are called conventional scan agents. product_name administrators can configure all or several agents to be in smart scan mode.

Installing the Trend Micro Remote Manager Agent
If you are a Trend Micro certified partner, you can install the agent for Trend Micro Remote Manager (TMRM).
If you chose not to install the TMRM agent after the Security Server installation completes, you can do so later.
TMRM Agent GUID
To obtain the GUID, open the TMRM Console and go to Customers (tab) All Customers (on the tree) {customer} WFBS/CSM Server/Agent Details (right pane) WFRM Agent Details
An active Internet connection
50MB of free disk space
For example: C:\Program Files\Trend Micro\Security Server\PCCSRV\Admin\Utility\RmAgent\TMRMAgentforWFBS.exe
If the customer already exists on the TMRM Console and you use the option above to associate with a new customer, this will result in two duplicate customers with the same name appearing on the TMRM network tree.
See your TMRM documentation for instructions.
Type the GUID.
If the installation is successful and settings are correct, the TMRM Agent should automatically register to the Trend Micro Remote Manager server.
If your environment has restrictions connecting to the Internet, in the case of a closed LAN or lack of an Internet connection.
Double-click ClnPack.exe.
The Client Packager console opens.
If the target client has an earlier Security Agent version installed and you want to upgrade, create the MSI file from the Security Server that manages the agent.
By default, this file is in \PCCSRV.
In Output file, click (), specify where you want to create the package, and type the package file name (for example, ClientSetup.exe).
Send the package to users and ask them to run the package by double-clicking the file (.msi or .exe).
Send the package only to users whose Security Agent will report to the server where the package was created.
If you are using Active Directory, you can automatically deploy the Security Agent to all clients simultaneously with the .msi file, rather than requiring each user to install the Security Agent themselves.
Use Computer Configuration instead of User Configuration so that the Security Agent can be installed regardless of which user logs on to the client.
If a newly installed Security Agent cannot connect to the Security Server, the Security Agent will keep default settings.
When the Security Agent connects to the Security Server, it will obtain the settings for its group in the web console.
If you encounter problems upgrading the Security Agent with Client Packager, Trend Micro recommends uninstalling the previous version of the Security Agent first, then installing the new version.
Login Script Setup automates the installation of the Security Agent to unprotected clients when they log on to the network.

Rule: product_short_name comes with default rules that filter content according to the following categories: Profanity, Racial Discrimination, Sexual Discrimination, Hoaxes, and Chainmail.
The Messaging Security Agent applies the Content Filtering rules to email messages according to the order shown in the Content Filtering screen.
If you enter a number higher than the total number of rules, product_short_name disregards the entry and does not change the order of the rule.
For example, if you select rule number 5 and change it to rule number 3, then rules number 1 and 2 remain the same, and rules numbered 3 and higher increase by one number.
When you delete a rule, the Messaging Security Agent updates the order of the other rules to reflect the change.
The Messaging Security Agent displays all the Data Loss Prevention rules on the Data Loss Prevention screen (Security Settings {Messaging Security Agent} Configure Settings Data Loss Prevention).
RuleName=Master Card No.
If you already have more than 10 rules, the imported rules will not be visible on the first page.
The Messaging Security Agent applies the Data Loss Prevention rules to email messages according to the order shown in the Data Loss Prevention screen.
Also, the processing load on Security Servers would be extreme if Data Loss Prevention had to filter all internal messages.

This chapter describes how to run scans on Security Agents and Messaging Security Agents (Advanced only) to protect your network and clients from threats.
Scan Targets and Actions for Security Agents
During installation, the Messaging Security Agent adds a folder, Spam Mail, to the server-side mailbox of each end user.
When spam messages arrive, the system quarantines them in this folder according to spam filter rules predefined by the Messaging Security Agent.
When an Administrator creates a mailbox account, the mailbox entity will not be created immediately in Microsoft Exchange server, but will be created under the following conditions:
When the end user receives an email message in the Spam Mail folder and clicks Approve Sender, the Messaging Security Agent moves the message to the end users local inbox and adds the sender's address to the end user's personal Approved Sender List.
The Messaging Security Agent logs the event.
When the Microsoft Exchange server receives messages from the addresses on the end user’s Approved Senders list, it delivers them to the end user’s inbox, regardless of the header or content of the message.
The Messaging Security Agent housekeeping feature performs the following tasks every 24 hours at the default time of 2:30 AM:
{Security Server installation folder}\PCCSRV\Private\contact_info.ini
The Security Server polls the Product Registration server and receives the new expiration date directly from the Product Registration server.

Manual Scan on Messaging Security Agents (Advanced only) scans all the files in the Information Store of your Microsoft Exchange server.
A Manual Scan in progress can be stopped by the Security Server administrator if the scan was run remotely from the web console, or by the user if the scan was run directly on the client.
You can enable the Messaging Security Agent (Advanced only) to take a special action against mass-mailing attacks whenever it detects a mass-mailing behavior.
For example: You configure the Messaging Security Agent to quarantine messages when it detects that the messages are infected by a worm or a Trojan.
This worm uses its own SMTP engine to send itself to email addresses that it collects from the infected computer.
When the agent detects the MyDoom worm and recognizes its mass-mailing behavior, it will delete the email message containing the worm - as opposed to the quarantine action for worms that do not show mass-mailing behavior.

The Messaging Security Agent requires the Intelligent Message Filter to integrate properly with the anti-spam features in Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 and 2007.
End User Quarantine: If selected, product_short_name creates a separate spam folder on Microsoft Outlook in addition to the Junk E-mail folder
Outlook Junk Email folder: If
Since Microsoft Outlook typically moves spam mail in the End User Quarantine (EUQ) folder to the Junk E-mail folder, Trend Micro recommends selecting this option.
The option to select between EUQ and the Junk E-mail folder is only available if the computer is running Exchange Server 2003. On Exchange Server 2007 and 2010, the EUQ option is disabled by default.
After installing a Messaging Security Agent remotely, repeat the agent installation process to install Messaging Security Agents remotely to other Microsoft Exchange servers.
Messaging Security Agents protect Microsoft Exchange servers.
The agent helps prevent email-borne threats by scanning email passing in and out of the Microsoft Exchange Mailbox Store as well as email that passes between the Microsoft Exchange Server and external destinations.
In addition, the Messaging Security Agent can:
Detect malicious URLs in email
Important Information about Messaging Security Agents
Multiple Messaging Security Agents cannot be combined into a group; each Messaging Security Agent must be administered and managed individually.
This information displays in the web console.
The Security Server also uses this information to generate logs and reports about the security status of your Microsoft Exchange servers.
This means that if the Messaging Security Agent detects multiple threats in a single email, it will generate multiple log entries and notifications.
There may also be instances when the same threat is detected several times, especially if you are using cache mode in Outlook 2003. When cache mode is enabled, the same threat may be detected both in the transport queue folder and Sent Items folder, or in the Outbox folder.
To prevent issues, the Messaging Security Agent services are designed to be dependent on the SQL Server service instance MSSQL$SCANMAIL.
When you install the Security Agent, Setup checks for any Trend Micro or third-party endpoint security software installed on the client.

Administrators identify which devices are allowed to access the Microsoft Exchange Server, and then identify whether the users of those devices can download or update their email, calendar, contacts, or tasks.
When moving an agent between Security Servers:
If an agent running an earlier version moves to a Security Server running the current version, the agent will be upgraded automatically.
Do not move an agent running the current version to a Security Server running a previous version because the agent will become unmanaged (the agent will unregister from its previous server but will fail to register to its new server, therefore, it will not appear in either web console).
The host name and listening port are found on the Security Server’s Security Settings screen, above the Tasks panel.
For example:cd C:\Program Files\Trend Micro\Security Agent
Run Client Mover using the following syntax:
-s -p -c

To check if the Security Agent now reports to the other Security Server, open that server’s web console and locate the agent in the Security Groups Tree.
To select multiple, adjacent Security Agents, click the first agent in the range, hold down the SHIFT key, and then click the last agent in the range.
To check if the agents now report to the other Security Server, open that server’s web console and locate the agents in the Security Groups Tree.
Move Security Agents between groups.
After moving, an agent will be grouped under the Desktops (default) or Servers (default) group in the other Security Server, depending on the operating system of the client.
After moving, an agent will be its own group in the other Security Server and will retain its settings.
Moving the Scan Server Database
If the disk drive on which the Scan Server is installed has insufficient disk space, use the Scan Server Database Mover tool to safely move the Scan Server database to another disk drive.
Be sure that the Security Server computer has more than 1 disk drive and that the new disk drive has at least 3GB of available disk space.
Launch ScanServerDBMover.exe.
The Security Server/Scan Server generates traffic when:
Instead of downloading an updated full pattern file, the Security Server only downloads the "incremental" patterns (smaller versions of the full pattern file) and merges them with the old pattern file after the download.
Otherwise, it downloads the full pattern file.
If you identify sections of your network between Security Agents and the Security Server as “low-bandwidth” or “heavy traffic”, you can specify Security Agents to act as update sources (Update Agents) for other agents.
For example, if your network is segmented by location, and the network link between segments experiences a heavy traffic load, Trend Micro recommends allowing at least one Security Agent on each segment to act as an Update Agent.
Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 support
product_short_name now supports Messaging Security Agent installation on endpoints running Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 on Windows Server 2016, as well as Server 2012 and Server 2012 R2.
Windows 10 Pro support
Windows Server 2016 support
Remote Manager Agent update enhancements
Installation of product_short_name 9.5 will automatically update the Remote Manager Agent to the latest version through Trend Micro ActiveUpdate.
For example, example.com and example.net.
For example, if the internal domain address is “@trend_1.com”, then the Messaging Security Agent classifies addresses such as “abc@trend_1.com” and “xyz@trend_1.com” as internal addresses.
If you use Microsoft Exchange System Manager to change your primary address on a server, Messaging Security Agent does not recognize the new address as an internal address because Messaging Security Agent cannot detect that the recipient policy has changed.
You set @example_1.com as the primary address.
Messaging Security Agent considers email messages with the primary address to be internal (that is, abc@example_1.com, or xyz@example_1.com are internal).

If the action for an infected file is "Quarantine", the Security Agent encrypts the file and temporarily moves it to a quarantine folder located in:
The Security Agent sends the infected file to a central quarantine directory, which you can configure from the web console, in Security Settings {Group} Configure Quarantine.
The equivalent absolute path is \PCCSRV\Virus.
If the server is managing both IPv4 and IPv6 agents, use the host name so that all agents can send quarantined files to the server.
You can specify an alternative central quarantine directory by typing the location in URL, UNC path, or absolute file path format.
For example, the directory should have an IPv6 address if it will receive quarantined files from dual-stack and pure IPv6 agents.
Trend Micro recommends designating a dual-stack directory, identifying the directory by its host name, and using UNC path when typing the directory.
Default directory on the Security Server
Another directory on the Security Server
\\\ D$\Quarantined Files
If you do not want to use the default directory (for example, if it has insufficient disk space), type the UNC path to another directory.
When the Messaging Security Agent detects a threat, spam, restricted attachment and/or restricted content in email messages, the agent can move the message to a quarantine folder.

Real-time Scan in the Messaging Security Agent (Advanced only) guards all known virus entry points by scanning all incoming messages, SMTP messages, documents posted on public folders, and files replicated from other Microsoft Exchange servers.
Each time a file is opened, downloaded, copied, or modified, Real-time Scan in the Security Agent scans the file for threats.
In the case of email messages, Real-time Scan in the Messaging Security Agent (Advanced only) guards all known virus entry points by scanning all incoming messages, SMTP messages, documents posted on public folders, and files replicated from other Microsoft Exchange servers.
When introducing new rules, use the archive action and observe how the Messaging Security Agent manages messages using your rule.
d.r matches deer, door, etc.
d(eer)+ matches deer or deereer or deereereer, etc. The + sign is applied to the substring within parentheses, so the regex looks for d followed by one or more of the grouping “eer.”
d[aeiouy]+ matches da, de, di, do, du, dy, daa, dae, dai, etc. The + sign is applied to the set within brackets parentheses, so the regex looks for d followed by one or more of any of the characters in the set [aeioy].
d[A-Z] matches dA, dB, dC, and so on up to dZ. The set in square brackets represents the range of all upper-case letters between A and Z.
[ ^ ]
Carat characters within square brackets logically negate the set or range specified, meaning the regex will match any character that is not in the set or range.
da{3} matches daaa--d followed by 3 and only 3 occurrences of “a”. da{2,4} matches daa, daaa, daaaa, and daaaa (but not daaaaa)--d followed by 2, 3, or 4 occurrences of “a”. da{4,} matches daaaa, daaaaa, daaaaaa, etc.--d followed by 4 or more occurrences of “a”.
\D matches a, ab, ab&, but not 1--one or more of any character but 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
\w matches a, ab, a1, but not !&--one or more upper- or lower-case letters or digits, but not punctuation or other special characters.
\W matches *, &, but not ace or a1--one or more of any character but upper- or lower-case letters and digits.
So the phrase “I like a vegetable in my soup” would trigger the regex, but “I like vegetables in my soup” would not.
Any non-white space character; anything other than a space, new line, tab, non-breaking space, etc.; functionally equivalent to [^[:space]]
So the phrase “I like vegetables in my soup” would trigger the regex, but “I like a vegetable in my soup” would not.
Any digit character; functionally equivalent to \d
matches 1, 12, 123, etc.
matches abc, 123, but not ~!@.
Any characters (similar with [:graph:])
matches ; : ? ! ~ @ # $ % & * ‘ “ , etc., but not 123, abc
Any lowercase alphabetic characters (Note: ‘Enable case sensitive matching’ must be enabled or else it will function as [:alnum:])
Any uppercase alphabetic characters (Note: ‘Enable case sensitive matching’ must be enabled or else it will function as [:alnum:])
Digits allowed in a hexadecimal number (0-9a-fA-F)
matches 0a, 7E, 0f, etc.
^(notwithstanding) matches any block of text that began with “notwithstanding” So the phrase “notwithstanding the fact that I like vegetables in my soup” would trigger the regex, but “The fact that I like vegetables in my soup notwithstanding” would not.
(notwithstanding)$ matches any block of text that ended with “notwithstanding” So the phrase “notwithstanding the fact that I like vegetables in my soup” would not trigger the regex, but “The fact that I like vegetables in my soup notwithstanding” would.
(1) .REG.
C\\C\+\+ matches ‘C\C++’.
\* matches *.
\? matches ?.
(stress)\t matches any block of text that contained the substring “stress” immediately followed by a tab (ASCII 0x09) character.
On Unix and Linux, a new line is just a line feed, and on Macintosh a new line is just a carriage return.
(stress)\n\n matches any block of text that contained the substring “stress” followed immediately by two new line (ASCII 0x0A) characters.
(stress)\r matches any block of text that contained the substring “stress” followed immediately by one carriage return (ASCII 0x0D) character.
(stress)\b matches any block of text that contained the substring “stress” followed immediately by one backspace (ASCII 0x08) character.
\x7E(\w){6} matches any block of text containing a “word” of exactly six alphanumeric characters preceded with a ~ (tilde) character.
[Format] .REG.
The above expression uses \b, a backspace character, followed by \d, any digit, then by {x}, indicating the number of digits, and finally, -, indicating a hyphen.

Click Manage Client Tree Remove Group/Client.
Remove Agents from the Web Console
An inactive agent continuously appears as offline on the web console because the client on which the agent is installed may have been powered off for a long time or reformatted before the agent can be uninstalled.
When the agent starts communicating with the server again (for example, after powering on the client), the agent is added back to the web console.
If the group no longer exists, the agent will be grouped under Servers (default) or Desktops (default), depending on the client’s operating system, and apply the settings of that group.
To use this feature, navigate to Preferences Global SettingsSystem tab and go to the Inactive Security Agent Removal section.
You can uninstall the agent (and consequently remove it from the web console) if you encounter problems with the agent program.

The conventional scan trend_client_program_single performs scanning on the endpoint.
The Scan Server is a service running on the Smart Scan Server.
Select Use install location to store the Scan Server database to the same folder as the Security Server or select Specify a different location and type the absolute path to another location on the Security Server.
It is not possible to specify a mapped drive or UNC path.
The Security Server includes a service called Scan Server, which is automatically installed during Security Server installation.
The Scan Server runs under the process name iCRCService.exe and appears as Trend Micro Smart Scan Service from Microsoft Management Console.
When Security Agents use a scan method called smart scan, the Scan Server helps these agents run scans more efficiently.
The Security Agent scans the client for security threats using the Smart Scan Agent Pattern, a lightweight version of the traditional Virus Pattern.
A Security Agent that cannot determine the risk of the file during the scan verifies the risk by sending a scan query to the Scan Server.
The Scan Server verifies the risk using the Smart Scan Pattern, which holds the threat signatures not available on the Smart Scan Agent Pattern.
The Security Agent "caches" the scan query result provided by the Scan Server to improve the scan performance.
By hosting some of the threat definitions, the Scan Server helps reduce the Security Agents’ bandwidth consumption when downloading components.
Instead of downloading the Virus Pattern, Security Agents download the Smart Scan Agent Pattern, which is significantly smaller in size.
When Security Agents are unable to connect to the Scan Server, they send scan queries to the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network, which has the same function as the Scan Server.
It is not possible to uninstall the Scan Server separately from the Security Server.
If you do not want to use the Scan Server:
On the Security Server computer, open Microsoft Management Console and disable the Trend Micro Smart Scan Service.
On the web console, switch Security Agents to conventional scan by navigating to Preferences Global SettingsDesktop/Server tab and selecting the option Disable Smart Scan Service.
Specific file types: product_short_name will scan files of the selected types and with the selected extensions.
Separate multiple entries with semicolons(;).
Enable IntelliTrap: IntelliTrap detects malicious code, such as bots, in compressed files.
Backup infected file before cleaning: product_short_name makes a backup of the threat before cleaning.
Message body size exceeds: The Messaging Security Agent only scans email messages when the size of the body of the message is smaller or equal to the specified amount.
Attachment size exceeds: The Messaging Security Agent only scans email messages when the size of the attachment file is smaller than or equal to the specified amount.
Trend Micro recommends a 30 MB limit.
Decompressed file count exceeds: When the amount of decompressed files within the compressed file exceeds this number, then the Messaging Security Agent only scans files up to the limit set by this option.
Size of decompressed file exceeds: The Messaging Security Agent only scans compressed files that are smaller or equal to this size after decompression.
Number of layers of compression exceeds: The Messaging Security Agent only scans compressed files that have less than or equal to the specified layers of compression.
For example, if you set the limit to 5 layers of compression, then the Messaging Security Agent will scan the first 5 layers of compressed files, but not scan files compressed to 6 or more layers.
Size of decompressed file is “x” times the size of compressed file: The Messaging Security Agent only scans compressed files when the ratio of the size of the decompressed file compared to the size of the compressed file is less than this number.
This function prevents the Messaging Security Agent from scanning a compressed file that might cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
A DoS attack happens when a mail server's resources are overwhelmed by unnecessary tasks.
Preventing the Messaging Security Agent from scanning files that decompress into very large files helps prevent this problem from happening.
Example: For the table below, the value typed for the “x” value is 100.
10 KB (ratio is 50:1)
1000 KB
1001 KB
10 KB (ratio exceeds 100:1)
Not scanned *
* The Messaging Security Agent takes the action you configure for excluded files.
Administrators can configure the Messaging Security Agent to take actions according to the type of threat presented by virus/malware, Trojans, and worms.
Messaging Security Agent Customized Actions
Under some conditions, the Messaging Security Agent cannot clean a file.
During a Manual Scan or Scheduled Scan, the Messaging Security Agent updates the Information Store and replaces the file with the cleaned one.
For Content Filtering and Data Loss Prevention, you can replace text only in the body or attachment fields (and not From, To, Cc, or Subject).
For Content Filtering, Data Loss Prevention, and Attachment Blocking, moves the entire message to the quarantine directory.
Sends the entire message to the Security Server for quarantine.
Select Notify recipients to set the Messaging Security Agent to notify the intended recipients when taking action against a specific email message.
The Messaging Security Agent takes action against malicious macro code depending on the action that you configure.
Level 1 uses the most specific criteria, but detects the least macro codes.
Level 4 detects the most macro codes, but uses the least specific criteria and may falsely identify safe macro code as harboring malicious macro code.
Trend Micro recommends a heuristic scan level of 2. This level provides a high detection level for unknown macro viruses, fast scanning speed, and it uses only the necessary rules to check for macro virus strings.
Level 2 also has a low level of incorrectly identifying malicious code in safe macro code.
If the action is replace with text/file, product_short_name will replace the threat with this text string and file.
Wildcard characters, such as “*”, are not accepted for file extensions
(Advanced only) If Microsoft Exchange Server is running on the client, Trend Micro recommends excluding all Microsoft Exchange Server folders from scanning.
Scan POP3 messages: By default, Mail Scan can only scan new messages sent through port 110 in the Inbox and Junk Mail folders.
It does not support secure POP3 (SSL-POP3).
Microsoft Outlook 2007, 2010, or 2013
Mozilla Thunderbird 1.5 or higher
Use the Messaging Security Agent (Advanced only) to detect security risks and spam in IMAP messages.
Scan compressed files up to layer __: A compressed file has one layer for each time it has been compressed.
CPU Usage/Scan Speed: The Security Agent can pause after scanning one file and before scanning the next file.
Run advanced cleanup: The Security Agent stops activities by rogue security software, also known as FakeAV.
product_name includes a list of potentially risky applications and, by default, prevents these applications from executing on clients.
The following are the actions that Security Agents can perform against viruses/malware:
The Security Agent encrypts quarantined files sent to this directory.
If the file is uncleanable, the Security Agent performs a second action, which can be one of the following actions: Quarantine, Delete, Rename, and Pass
Changes the infected file's extension to "vir".
The Security Agent cannot use this scan action during Real-time Scan because performing no action when an attempt to open or execute an infected file is detected will allow virus/malware to execute.
When the Security Agent detects an attempt to open or execute an infected file, it immediately blocks the operation.
The scan action the Security Agent performs depends on the scan type that detected the spyware/grayware.
For example, when the Security Agent detects any type of spyware/grayware during Manual Scan (scan type), it cleans (action) the affected system resources.
The following are the actions the Security Agent can perform against spyware/grayware:
Terminates processes or deletes registries, files, cookies, and shortcuts.
The Security Agent will not perform any action if the detected spyware/grayware is included in the approved list.
WFBS scn_adv_sttng_sched_wfbs_agent
WFBS scn_except_settings_sched_agent_wfbs
A Scheduled Scan is similar to Manual Scan but scans all files and email messages (Advanced only) at the configured time and frequency.

Security Agent Icons
This appendix explains the different Security Agent icons that display on clients.
This topic discusses considerations when installing the Security Agent to dual-stack or pure IPv6 clients.
The Security Agent can only be installed on the following operating systems that support IPv6 addressing:
Windows Server 2008/2008 R2 (all editions)
Windows SBS 2008/2011
Windows Server 2016 (Standard, Datacenter, Essentials)
All of the available installation methods can be used to install the Security Agent on pure IPv6 or dual-stack clients.
For some installation methods, there are special requirements to install the Security Agent successfully.
If you are installing to a pure IPv6 client, the Security Server must be dual-stack or pure IPv6 and its host name or IPv6 address must be part of the URL.
For dual-stack clients, the IPv6 address that displays in the installation status screen depends on the option selected in the Preferred IP Address section in Preferences Global SettingsDesktop/Server tab.
Vulnerability Scanner and Remote Install
A pure IPv6 Security Server cannot install the Security Agent on pure IPv4 clients.
Similarly, a pure IPv4 Security Server cannot install the agent on pure IPv6 clients.
Security Agent IP Addresses
A Security Server installed in an environment that supports IPv6 addressing can manage the following Security Agents:
A Security Server installed on a pure IPv6 client can manage pure IPv6 Security Agents.
A Security Server installed on a dual-stack client and has been assigned both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can manage pure IPv6, dual-stack, and pure IPv4 Security Agents.
After you install or upgrade Security Agents, the agents register to the Security Server using an IP address.
Pure IPv6 Security Agents register using their IPv6 address.
Dual-stack Security Agents register using either their IPv4 or IPv6 address.
You can choose the IP address that these agents will use in the Preferred IP Address section in Preferences Global SettingsDesktop/Server tab.
Before installing Security Agents, consider the following:
Agent features: Some Security Agent features are not available on certain Windows platforms.
x64 platforms: A scaled down version of the Security Agent is available for the x64 platform.
However, no support is currently available for the IA-64 platform.
IPv6 support: The Security Agent can be installed on dual-stack or pure IPv6 clients.
Some of the Windows operating systems to which the agent can be installed do not support IPv6 addressing.
Agent installation directory: During the Security Server installation, Setup prompts you to specify the agent installation directory, which is $ProgramFiles\Trend Micro\Security Agent by default.
If you want to install the Security Agents to a different directory, specify the new directory in PreferencesGlobal Settings SystemSecurity Agent Installation section.
Security Agent installation methods
This section provides a summary of the different installation methods to perform a fresh installation of the Security Agent.
If you are installing Security Agents and want to enable IPv6 support, read the guidelines in .
Windows 8/8.1 Basic
Windows 10 Home
For single-site deployment and in organizations where IT policies are strictly enforced, IT administrators can choose to deploy using Remote Install or Login Script Setup.
In organizations where IT policies are less strictly enforced, Trend Micro recommends installing Security Agents using the Internal Web Page.
Using this method, however, requires that end users who will install the Security Agent to have administrator privileges.
Remote Install is efficient for networks with Active Directory.
If your network does not use Active Directory, use the Internal Web Page.
Installation Path: The destination folder where the Security Agent files are installed
Security Agent Listening Port: The port number used for Security Agent and Security Server communications
Perform a fresh installation of the Security Agent on Windows clients (desktops and servers).
Close any running applications on clients before installing the Security Agent.
For information on upgrading Security Agents to this version, see the Installation and Upgrade Guide.
Configure Security Agent settings for Servers and Desktops.
Servers: Security Agents running Windows server platforms (such as Windows Server 2008) will be added to the default Servers group when you first add them to the Web Console.
Desktops: Security Agents running Windows desktop platforms (such as Windows Vista) will be added to the default Desktops group when you first add them to the Web Console.
Web Reputation: Blocks malicious websites through the credibility of Web domains and assigning a reputation score based on several identifying factors
URL Filtering: Blocks specified categories of websites (for example, pornographic, social networking) according to your company’s policy
Trusted Program: Allows frequently used I/O applications to be configured from the user interface
Consider the following when installing the Security Server:
All 64-bit versions of the listed operating systems are supported unless noted otherwise.
The Security Server does not support Windows server operating systems that run the Server Core environment.
Anniversary Update or Creators Update
Setup checks if a web server exists on the target computer.
Web Server Detection Scenarios

For a typical or minimal installation, Setup automatically uses IIS.
Setup automatically uses IIS if the Apache web server version is not supported (only version 2.2.22 is supported)
You can choose either of the two web servers if the Apache web server version is supported.
If the endpoint runs Windows 7, 8, 8.1, or 10, Trend Micro recommends a custom installation and choosing Apache as the web server.
Setup detects only an IIS web server
For a custom installation, you can choose either of the two web servers.
If you choose Apache, Setup automatically installs Apache version 2.2.22.
Setup detects only an Apache web server
Setup uses Apache if the Apache version is 2.2.22.
Installation cannot proceed if other Apache versions exist.
Uninstall Apache if no application is using it.
Upgrade Apache to version 2.2.22 if any of these versions is compatible with the applications that use Apache.
Choose another computer on which to install the Security Server.
The following platforms have IIS and are supported by the Security Server:
Windows Server 2008 or 2008 R2
If Setup cannot detect IIS on these platforms, IIS may have been disabled (by default or by the system administrator).
Enable IIS if this is your preferred web server.

At the center of product_name is the Security Server.
The Security Server hosts the web console, the centralized web-based management console for product_name.
The Security Server installs agents to clients on the network and along with the agents, forms an agent-server relationship.
The Security Server enables viewing security status information, viewing agents, configuring system security, and downloading components from a centralized location.
The Security Server also contains the database where it stores logs of detected Internet threats being reported to it by the agents.
The Security Server performs these important functions:
By default, the Security Server downloads components from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server and then distributes them to agents.
Security Server (Required): The Security Server hosts the centralized web console
Security Agent (Optional): The agent that protects desktops and servers
Messaging Security Agent (Optional): When installing the Security Server on a computer that has a Microsoft Exchange server installed on the same computer, Setup prompts you to install a local Messaging Security Agent (Advanced only).
Remote Messaging Security Agent (optional): When installing the Security Server on a computer that cannot detect the existence of local Microsoft Exchange servers, Setup prompts you to install the remote Messaging Security Agent to remote servers (Advanced only).
If there is an Exchange server on the same computer to which you are installing the Security Server, the remote Messaging Security Agent will not show on the Select Components screen; only the local Messaging Security Agent will show.

Trend Micro Security (for Mac) Client Requirements
The Support/Debugger can assist you in debugging or just reporting the status of the Messaging Security Agent processes.
Each Messaging Security Agent inserts messages into the program, and then records the action into log files upon execution.
Virus Scan API (VSAPI)
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
By default, the MSA keeps the logs in the following directory:
After you have created your rule, the Messaging Security Agent begins to filter all incoming and outgoing messages according to your rule.
When a content violation occurs, the Messaging Security Agent takes action against the violating email message.
The action that the Security Server takes also depends on the actions that you set in your rule.
Uncleanable by the Messaging Security Agent (Advanced only)
If the Messaging Security Agent is unable to successfully clean a file, it labels the file “uncleanable” and performs the user-configured action for uncleanable files.
The Messaging Security Agent records all virus events and associated courses of action in the log file.
Some common reasons why the Messaging Security Agent cannot perform the clean action are as follows:
To stop an executable from executing, the Messaging Security Agent must completely remove it.
The Messaging Security Agent does not support all compression forms.
The scan engine only cleans files compressed using pkzip and only when the infection is in the first layer of compression.
An unexpected problem prevents the Messaging Security Agent from cleaning, such as:
Open the command prompt and go to the Windows Temp folder (located at C:\Windows\Temp by default).
Open a command prompt and go to the Internet Explorer Temp folder (located in C:\Users\\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files by default).
When uninstalling the Messaging Security Agent, the IIS Admin service/Apache server and all related services will automatically be stopped and restarted.
To uninstall Security Agents, select a group and then select the agents.
To uninstall a Messaging Security Agent, select it.
For a Messaging Security Agent, type the corresponding Microsoft Exchange server account name and password when prompted.
If the Security Agent uninstallation fails, see .
Uninstalling the Messaging Security Agent from the Microsoft Exchange Server (Advanced Only)
Log on to the Microsoft Exchange Server with Administrator rights.
Locate Trend Micro Messaging Security Agent and click Change.
The password can be set or disabled at Preferences Global SettingsDesktop/Server tabSecurity Agent Uninstallation Password.
Locate Trend Micro Worry-Free Business Security Agent and click Change or Uninstall, whichever is available.
The Security Server notifies the user of the uninstallation progress and completion.
Uninstalling the Security Server also uninstalls the Scan Server.
Remove the Agent from all clients before removing the Security Server.
A confirmation message appears after Security Server has been uninstalled.
Messaging Components (Advanced only)
Messaging Security Agent Anti-spam Engine 32/64-bit
Messaging Security Agent Scan Engine 32/64-bit
The Scan Engine detects Internet worms, mass-mailers, Trojans, phishing sites, spyware, network exploits and viruses in email messages and email attachments.
Messaging Security Agent URL Filtering Engine 32/64-bit
The URL Filtering Service is a system that rates URLs and provides rating information to product_name.
If product_name is protecting Microsoft Exchange servers (Advanced only), you can also view the status of Anti-spam components. product_name can send a notification to Administrators when component updates is necessary.
Update Agents are Security Agents that can receive updated components from the Security Server or ActiveUpdate server and deploy them to other Security Agents.
Update Agents reduce network bandwidth consumption by eliminating the need for all Security Agents to access the Security Server for component updates.
If your network is segmented by location and the network link between segments frequently experiences a heavy traffic load, Trend Micro recommends allowing at least one Security Agent on each segment to act as an Update Agent.
The Security Server notifies the Update Agents that new updates are available.
The Update Agents download the updated components from the Security Server.
The Security Server then notifies the Security Agents that updated components are available.
Each Security Agent loads a copy of the Update Agent Order Table to determine its appropriate update source.
The order of the Update Agents in the Update Agent Order Table is initially determined by the order in which they were added as Alternative Update Sources on the web console.
Each Security Agent will go through the table one entry at a time, starting with the first entry, until it identifies its update source.
The Security Agents then download the updated components from their assigned Update Agent.
If for some reason the assigned Update Agent is not available, the Security Agent will attempt to download updated components from the Security Server.
Updating the Security Server Manually
Manually update the components on the Security Server after installing or upgrading the server and whenever there is an outbreak.
If the update is successful, the Security Server automatically distributes the updated components to agents.
You can preserve your client settings when you upgrade to the newest version of WFBS.
Backing up the Security Server database
Deleting all log files from the Security Server
Backing Up the Security Server Database
In Windows Explorer, go to the Security Server folder and copy the contents of \PCCSRV\HTTPDB to another location (for example, to a different folder on the same server, to another computer, or to a removable drive).
Deleting Log Files from the Security Server
Set Delete Logs Older Than to 0 for a log type.
Repeat steps 2 to 3 for all log types.
Consider the following when upgrading the Security Server and agents.
Upgrade Method 1: Using the Installation Package to Upgrade
Obtain the installation package for this product version and then run Setup.exe on the Security Server computer.
When Setup detects that an existing Security Server exists on the computer, it prompts you to upgrade, as shown in the following image.
Follow the on-screen instructions to upgrade the Security Server.
On one of the installation screens, choose from the following Security Agent upgrade options:
Security Agent Upgrade Option
Automatically upgrade all Security Agents in your network
If you have a small number of Security Agents, allow all agents to upgrade immediately after the Security Server upgrades.
All agents will upgrade, even if the option Disable Security Agent/program upgrade and hot fix deployment is enabled on the web console, in Security Settings {Group} Configure Client Privileges.
The option Disable Security Agent/program upgrade and hot fix deployment only prevents build upgrades (for example, from the Beta build to the release build) but not version upgrades.
Allow clients to delay upgrading their Security Agent for a maximum period of __ hours
Select this option when upgrading a large number of Security Agents.
Specify the maximum number of hours (2, 4, 8, 12, or 24 hours) to delay the upgrade.
After the Security Server upgrades, it sends upgrade notifications to all Security Agents.Users see a popup message on their computers, prompting them to upgrade.
If users do nothing, the upgrade automatically starts 5 minutes after the message displays.
If users click Remind Me Later, the Security Agent displays the popup message every 30 minutes until the upgrade has been started, either by the user or automatically (if users do nothing or after the maximum number of hours you specified has elapsed).
Online Security Agents upgrade immediately or after a number of hours, depending on the upgrade option you selected.
Offline Security Agents upgrade when they become online.
Instruct users to connect to the network so that the Security Agent can become online.
For Security Agents that are offline for an extended period of time, instruct users to uninstall the Security Agent from the endpoint and then use a suitable agent installation method (such as Client Packager) discussed in the Administrator’s Guide to install the Security Agent.
This means that Update Agents will revert to being Security Agents after the upgrade.
Refer to for details.
Upgrade Method 2: Move Agents to Security Server 9.5
Perform a fresh installation of the Security Server and then move Security Agents to this server.
When you move the agents, they automatically upgrade to version 9.5.
Part 1: Perform a Fresh Installation of Security Server 9.5
Perform a fresh installation of the Security Server on a computer.
Record the following Security Server 9.5 information.
Specify this information on the Security Server 7.x, 8.x, or 9.0 when moving agents.
Part 2: Upgrade Agents
On the Security Server 7.x, 8.x, or 9.0 web console, navigate to Security Settings.
Type the host name and listening port of the Security Server 9.5 to which agents will move.
After upgrading, Security Agents will be grouped under the Desktops (default) or Servers (default) group on the Security Server 9.5, depending on the operating system of the endpoint.
Security Agents will be grouped under the Desktops (default) or Servers (default) group on the Security Server 9.5, depending on the operating system of the endpoint.

This chapter explains the product_name Outbreak Defense strategy, how to configure Outbreak Defense, and how to use it to protect networks and clients.
Each Security Agent installation needs a unique Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) so that the Security Server can identify agents individually.
Duplicate GUIDs typically occur on cloned clients or virtual machines.
If two or more agents report the same GUID, run the ReGenID tool to generate a unique GUID for each client.
On the Security Server, go to the following directory: \PCCSRV\Admin\Utility.
Copy WFBS_WIN_All_ReGenID.exe to a temporary folder on the client where the Security Agent is installed.
Double-click WFBS_WIN_All_ReGenID.exe.
The tool stops the Security Agent and removes the client GUID.
Restart the Security Agent.
The Security Agent generates a new client GUID.

Web Console Requirements
The web console is the central point for monitoring clients throughout the corporate network.
It comes with a set of default settings and values that you can configure based on your security requirements and specifications.
The web console uses standard Internet technologies, such as Java, CGI, HTML, and HTTP.
Use the web console to:
With one of the largest domain-reputation databases in the world, Trend Micro web reputation technology tracks the credibility of web domains by assigning a reputation score based on factors such as a website's age, historical location changes and indications of suspicious activities discovered through malware behavior analysis.
Web Reputation helps prevent access to URLs on the web or embedded in email messages that pose security risks.
Web Reputation checks the URL’s reputation against the Trend Micro web reputation servers and then correlates the reputation with the specific web reputation policy enforced on the client.
The Security Agent will block or allow access to the website.
The Messaging Security Agent (Advanced only) will quarantine, delete, or tag the email message containing malicious URLs, or allow the message to be sent if the URLs are safe.
For Security Agents, configure a different level of security based on the location (In Office/Out of Office) of the client.
A URL's “reputation score” determines whether it is a web threat or not.
Trend Micro considers a URL a web threat if its score falls within a defined threshold, and safe if its score exceeds the threshold.
A Security Agent has three security levels that determine whether it will allow or block access to a URL.
For a fresh installation, Setup checks if a web server exists on the target computer.
Setup automatically uses IIS if the Apache web server version is not supported (only versions 2.0.54, 2.0.55, 2.0.6x, and 2.2.22 are supported)
If the computer runs Windows Vista, 7, 8, or 8.1 Trend Micro recommends a custom installation and choosing Apache as the web server.
Setup uses Apache if the Apache version is 2.0.54, 2.0.55, 2.0.6x, or 2.2.22.
Upgrade Apache to version 2.0.54, 2.0.55, 2.0.6x, or 2.2.22 if any of these versions is compatible with the applications that use Apache.
Windows Server 2003/2003 R2
Windows SBS 2003/2003 R2
Enable IIS in this case.
For upgrades, if Apache is currently used as web server:
Setup automatically upgrades the Apache version to 2.2.22 if the Apache web server was installed by the product_short_name 6.x/7.x/8.x Setup program.

Welcome to the Trend Micro product_name_trademarked Installation and Upgrade Guide.
Upgrading the Security Server and agents
Generic Product Variables
product_short_name Ports
product_short_name uses the following ports:
Server listening port (HTTP port): Used to access the Security Server.
By default, product_short_name uses one of the following:
IIS server default website: The same port number as your HTTP server’s TCP port.
IIS server virtual website: 8059
Apache server: 8059
Client listening port: A randomly generated port number through which the Security Agent and Messaging Security Agent receive commands from the Security Server.
Today’s cyber criminals use HTTP and direct their attacks at ports 80 and/or 8080 – commonly used in most organizations as the default Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) ports for HTTP communications.
If your organization is currently using one of these ports as the HTTP port, Trend Micro recommends using another port number.
To find out which port your Security Agents are using to connect to the Scan Server, open SSCFG.ini in the folder where the server is installed.
Scan Server ports: Used by the Scan Server to communicate with Security Agents for scan queries.
Scan Server Ports
IIS default
IIS Virtual
Pre-Installed Apache
New Apache Installation
Non-SSL port
Non-SSL port on web server
First open port in range 8082 to 65536
Using SSL
SSL port on web server
Not using SSL
Trend Micro Security (for Mac) Communication port: Used by the Trend Micro Security (for Mac) server to communicate with Mac clients.
The default is port 61617.
SMTP port: Used by the Security Server to send reports and notifications to administrators through email.
Proxy port: Used for connections through a proxy server.
The following table lists the limitations when the Security Server only has an IPv6 address.
Deploy agents to pure IPv4 clients
Manage pure IPv4 agents.
Pure IPv4 agents or pure IPv4 hosts (because of the absence of a direct connection)
Pure IPv6 agents or pure IPv6 hosts because none of the plug-in solutions support IPv6.
Position the proxy server between the Security Server and the entities to which it connects or the entities that it serves.
The Security Server retains the current and the previous versions of the Virus Scan Engine, and the last three versions of the Virus Pattern and Smart Scan Agent Pattern.
product_name uses different scan engines for agents running 32-bit and 64-bit platforms.
Navigate to Updates Rollback.
Click Rollback for a specific component to roll back that component on both the Security Server and agents.
Whenever the Security Groups Tree displays, the IPv6 addresses of pure IPv6 agents display under the IP address column.
For dual-stack agents, their IPv6 addresses display if they used their IPv6 address to register to the server.
The IP address that dual-stack agents use when registering to the server can be controlled in the Preferred IP Address section in Preferences Global SettingsDesktop/Server tab.
When you export agent settings to a file, the IPv6 addresses also display in the exported file.
The IPv6 addresses of dual-stack and pure IPv6 agents display on the logs.
If a server is identified by its IPv4 address, pure IPv6 agents cannot connect to the server.
The same issue occurs if pure IPv4 clients connect to a server identified by its IPv6 address.
Verify that the host machine’s IPv6 or IPv4 address can be retrieved using, for example, the “ping” or “nslookup” command.
If you are installing the Security Server to a pure IPv6 computer, set up a dual-stack proxy server that can convert between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (such as DeleGate).
Position the proxy server between the Security Server and the Internet to allow the server to successfully connect to Trend Micro hosted services, such as the ActiveUpdate server, the Online Registration website, and Smart Protection Network.
The Security Server automatically performs the following updates:
Immediately after installing the Security Server, it updates from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server.
Whenever the Security Server starts, it updates the components and the Outbreak Defense policy.
By default, scheduled updates run every hour (the update frequency can be changed from the web console).
You can run manual updates from the web console if an update is urgent.
After an update, the Security Server automatically distributes the component updates to agents.
A pure IPv6 Security Server cannot perform the following tasks:
Obtain updates directly from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server or a pure IPv4 custom update source.
Distribute updates directly to pure IPv4 agents.
Similarly, a pure IPv4 Security Server cannot obtain updates directly from a pure IPv6 custom update source and distribute updates to pure IPv6 agents.
In these situations, a dual-stack proxy server that can convert IP addresses, such as DeleGate, is required to allow the Security Server to obtain and distribute updates.
If you use a proxy server to connect to the Internet, set the correct proxy settings in Preferences Global Settings Proxy tab to download updates successfully.
Since pattern file updates are available regularly, the Security Server uses a mechanism called component duplication that allows faster downloads of pattern files.
For example, if the latest version is 175, incremental pattern v_173.175 contains signatures in version 175 not found in version 173 (version 173 is the previous full pattern version since pattern numbers are released in increments of 2).
Incremental pattern v_171.175 contains signatures in version 175 not found in version 171.
To reduce network traffic generated when downloading the latest pattern, the Security Server performs component duplication, a component update method where the server downloads only incremental patterns.
To take advantage of component duplication, be sure that the Security Server is updated regularly.
Worry-Free Business Security 9.5 System Requirements
When updates are available, the Security Server downloads the updated components and then distributes them to Security Agents and Messaging Security Agents (Advanced only).
If a Security Server manages a large number of Security Agents, updating may utilize a significant amount of server computer resources, affecting the server’s stability and performance.
To address this issue, product_name has an Update Agent feature that allows certain Security Agents to share the task of distributing updates to other Security Agents.
The following table describes the component update options for the Security Server and agents, and recommendations on when to use them:
Use this method if there are no low-bandwidth sections between the Security Server and agents.
Update Agents, Messaging Security Agents, Security Agents without Update Agents
All other Security Agents
Security Agents without Update Agents
The Update Agents then deploy the components to their respective Security Agents.
If these Security Agents are unable to update, they update directly from the Security Server.
If there are low-bandwidth sections between the Security Server and Security Agents, use this method to balance the traffic load on the network.
Security Agents that cannot update from any source update directly from the ActiveUpdate server.
Messaging Security Agents never update directly from the ActiveUpdate server.
If all sources are unavailable, the Messaging Security Agent quits the update process.
The Firewall exception list contains entries you can configure to allow or block different kinds of network traffic based on client port numbers and IP addresses.
During an outbreak, the Security Server applies the exceptions to the Trend Micro policies that are automatically deployed to protect your network.
For example, during an outbreak, you may choose to block all client traffic, including the HTTP port (port 80).
However, if you still want to grant the blocked clients access to the Internet, you can add the web proxy server to the exception list.
Use a comma "," to separate port numbers.
Under Machines, select client IP addresses to include in the exception.
For example, if you select Deny all network traffic (Inbound and Outbound) and type the IP address for a client on the network, then any client that has this exception in its policy will not be able to send or receive data to or from that IP address.
All IP addresses (default)
Single IP: Type an IPv4 or IPv6 address, or a host name.
To resolve the client host name to an IP address, click Resolve.
IP range (for IPv4 or IPv6): Type either two IPv4 or two IPv6 addresses in the From and To fields.
It is not possible to type an IPv6 address in one field and an IPv4 address in the other field.
IP range (for IPv6): Type an IPv6 address prefix and length.
Click the plus icon (+) to expand the selection.
Recipients: Type the recipients’ email addresses, separating them with semicolons (;).
Format: Choose PDF or a link to an HTML report.
If you choose PDF, the PDF will be attached to the email.
The first link opens a PDF report while the second link opens an HTML report.
To automatically delete reports, navigate to Reports MaintenanceReports tab and set the maximum number of one-time reports that product_short_name retains.
The default is 10 one-time reports.
When the number is exceeded, the Security Server deletes reports beginning with the report that has been retained for the longest time.
Plug-in Manager displays the programs for both the Security Server and Agents in the web console as soon as they become available.
You can then install and manage the programs from the web console, including deploying the client plug-in programs to Agents.
Download and install Plug-in Manager from Preferences Plug-Ins.
See the documentation for Plug-in Manager and plug-in programs for more information.
To access Real-time Monitor from the web console:
To access Real-time Monitor from the Windows Start Menu, click All ProgramsTrend Micro Messaging Security AgentReal-time Monitor.
For monthly reports, if you select 31, 30, or 29 days and a month has less than the number of days, WFBS will not generate the report that month.
Deleting a template does not delete scheduled reports generated from the template but the links to the reports will no longer be available from the web console.
You can access the reports directly from the Security Server computer.
Reports will only be deleted if you manually delete them from the computer or if the Security Server automatically deletes the reports according to the scheduled report auto-deletion setting in ReportsMaintenance Reports tab.
To automatically delete templates, navigate to Reports MaintenanceReports tab and set the maximum number of templates that product_short_name retains.

Migrating Settings from Smart Protection Server 3.1
product_name provides a command line Migration Tool which allows you to transfer preconfigured settings from product_name 3.1 to the latest version.
You can only migrate settings from previous product_name versions before you initialize product_name 3.3.
After initializing product_name 3.3, you can no longer migrate settings unless you uninstall and reinstall the server.
Open a command line on the product_name 3.3 virtual machine using root account credentials.
After the migration process completes successfully, product_name 3.3 automatically reboots and applies the migrated settings.
Open the product_name 3.3 console using the admin account and verify the migrated settings.
If the update is unsuccessful, check that you can access the Internet and that your proxy settings are correct (AdministrationProxy Settings).
Check all other settings in the product_name web console.
If the previous product_name 3.1 computer required certificates, you must re-import the certificates.
To continue using the same IP address of your previous version of product_name on the product_name 3.3 console, shut down the previous version of product_name.
product_name 3.3 requires a virtual machine instance with at least the same specifications as the computer that you want to migrate settings from.
The product_name 3.3 ISO must be installed on the virtual machine instance before running the tool.
SSH must be enabled on the product_name computer that you want to migrate settings from.
The redesigned product_short_name dashboard provides a more streamlined view of all widgets and tabs.
Support for Community Domain/IP Reputation Service
product_short_name now supports Community Domain/IP Reputation Service query.

The Blocked URLs stop collecting data if product_name detects that the available disk space is less than 1GB.
product_name starts collecting data again once the administrator has made at least 1.5GB of disk space available.
product_name already has a purpose-built, hardened, performance-tuned 64-bit Linux operating system.
The product_name kernel module will install the VMWare Tools module vmxnet3.

On the Plug-in Manager screen, go to the plug-in program section and click Download. The size of the plug-in program package displays beside the Download button.
Notes:	Plug-in Manager downloads the package from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server, the default download source, to a temporary folder on the Worry-Free Business Security installation directory (\PCCSRV\Download\Product).	If a plug-in program does not display, click here for the reasons and solutions.
Note: If you encounter problems downloading the package, check the server update logs on the Web console. On the main menu, click Log Query.
After Plug-in Manager downloads the package, a new screen displays, providing you the following options: Install Now or Install Later.
If you choose to install at a later time, open the Plug-in Manager screen, go to the plug-in program section and click Install. Agree to the license agreement and then check the installation progress.
On the Plug-in Manager screen, go to the plug-in program section and click Manage Program to configure settings and perform program-related tasks.
Tasks may include activating the program and deploying it to Clients. Note that the Agent also has Plug-in Manager that communicates with the server Plug-in Manager. When you deploy a plug-in program to Agents from the Web console, the Agent Plug-in Manager notifies the Agent to install the plug-in program.
Note: The Agent Plug-in Manager has the same system requirements as the Agent. The only additional requirement is Microsoft XML Parser (MSXML) version 3.0 or later.
The installation path for a plug-in program on the Client is \Trend Micro\{Plug-in program name}. If Clients are unable to install the plug-in program, click here for the reasons and solutions.
Plug-in Manager and plug-in program upgrade
When an upgrade package for Plug-in Manager or a plug-in program becomes available, the version number and a Download button displays on the Plug-in Manager screen. The size of the upgrade package displays beside the Download button.
For Plug-in Manager upgrade, as soon as you begin downloading the upgrade package or start the upgrade, you will not be able to download, install, or upgrade plug-in programs.
To upgrade Plug-in Manager or a plug-in program:
Note: If you encounter problems downloading the upgrade package, check the server update logs on the Web console. On the main menu, click Log Query.
After Plug-in Manager downloads the upgrade package, a new screen displays, providing you the following options: Upgrade Now or Upgrade Later.
If you choose to upgrade at a later time, open the Plug-in Manager screen, click Upgrade Later, and then check the upgrade progress.
After the Plug-in Manager upgrade, the Plug-in Manager service may need to restart, causing the Plug-in Manager screen to be temporarily unavailable. When the screen becomes available, the current Plug-in Manager program version displays.
Plug-in Manager and plug-in program uninstallation
You can uninstall Plug-in Manager from the Windows Add/Remove Programs screen, and plug-in programs from the Plug-in Manager screen on the Web console.
To uninstall a plug-in program from the Plug-in Manager screen:
Uninstalling the Worry-Free Business Security automatically uninstalls Plug-in Manager and all plug-in programs on the server. Similarly, uninstalling the Agent also uninstalls the plug-in programs on the Client.
Copyright © 2008. Trend Micro Incorporated. All rights reserved.
Check the Worry-Free Business Security and Agent debug logs for Plug-in Manager and plug-in program debug information.
If a plug-in program does not display, check the Plug-in Manager update source. On the Web console, go to Source &gt; Server
A. Trend Micro ActiveUpdate Server
At the time you install Plug-in Manager, Trend Micro has not released any plug-in program yet. Please note that plug-in program release is independent of WFBS or Plug-in Manager release.
Plug-in Manager checks the ActiveUpdate server for any available plug-in program and automatically displays any new program on the Plug-in Manager screen.
The Security Server cannot connect to the Internet. Plug-in Manager requires Internet connection so it can download the plug-in program package from the ActiveUpdate server.
If the Security Server connects to the Internet through a proxy server, make sure Internet connection can be established using the proxy settings.
Restart the Plug-in Manager service after Internet connection is established.
There are problems with the Plug-in Manager component list, OSCE_AOS_COMP_LIST.xml, &nbsp;found under the \PCCSRV folder on the server computer.
The component list provides information on the plug-in programs that Plug-in Manager should display on the console and is downloaded by Plug-in Manager from the ActiveUpdate server. Plug-in Manager polls the ActiveUpdate server for the component list every 24 hours and downloads any new version.
To manually trigger Plug-in Manager to download the component list, perform the following steps:
Open registry editor and navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\TrendMicro\OfficeScan\service\	AoS\OSCE_Addon_Service_CompList_Version.
Delete the plug-in program registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\TrendMicro\	OfficeScan\service\AoS\OSCE_ADDON_xxxx.
B. An update source other than the ActiveUpdate server
When the update source is not the ActiveUpdate server (either Alternate update source or Intranet location containing a copy of the current file), a plug-in program may not display for the following reasons:
The Security Server cannot connect to the update source.
If you use Alternate update source and you have specified multiple update sources, make sure Plug-in Manager can connect to the first update source on the list. If Plug-in Manager cannot connect to the first update source, it does not attempt to connect to the other update sources.
Restart the Plug-in Manager service when connection to the update source is established.
The Security Server can connect to the update source but the update source does not contain the plug-in program packages or the latest component list (OSCE_AOS_COMP_LIST.xml). The component list provides information on the plug-in programs that Plug-in Manager should display on the console.
Verify that the update source can successfully connect to the ActiveUpdate server. Check if the update source has Internet connection and, using ping command, can connect to If connection is successful, refer to A. Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server above for additional reasons why the plug-in program does not display.
Restart the Plug-in Manager service when connection to the ActiveUpdate server is established.
Restart the Plug-in Manager service after the component list and packages are downloaded to the update source.
Error messages display when downloading/installing/upgrading/uninstalling Plug-in Manager and plug-in programs.
Below are Plug-in Manager and plug-in program error messages and solutions. If you are unable to resolve a problem after referring to the solutions, please contact your Support provider.
Plug-in Manager was unable to download a plug-in program. An ActiveUpdate error occurred.
If the update source is the ActiveUpdate server, go to {WFBS installation folder}\PCCSRV and open the OSCE_AOS_COMP_LIST.xml file. Check if this file contains the plug-in program you attempted to download.
If OSCE_AOS_COMP_LIST.xml contains the program, download the plug-in program again. If downloading fails again, contact your Support provider.
If OSCE_AOS_COMP_LIST.xml does not contain the program, contact your Support provider for more information.
server.ini file
OSCE_AOS_COMP_LIST.xml file
Unable to download Plug-in Manager or the plug-in program installation package. The update source may have been changed or the installation package may have been removed from the update source.
Plug-in Manager cannot install the plug-in program. Possible reasons:
An error in the AU patch agent occurred. The AU patch agent is the program that launches installation of new plug-in programs.
Plug-in Manager is unable to open the registry key SOFTWARE\TrendMicro\OfficeScan\service\AoS because it may have been deleted.
The Apache Web Server version is not supported.
Plug-in Manager handles some of the Web requests using Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI). ISAPI is not compatible with Apache Web server versions 2.0.56 to 2.0.59 and versions 2.2.3 to 2.2.4.
You can restore an unsupported Apache Web server version. For example, you can restore version 2.0.59 to version 2.0.54.
To restore Apache Web Server version 2.0.59 to 2.0.54:
Upgrade the Worry-Free Business Security server to version 5.0.
Back up the following files on the Apache2 folder on the Worry-Free Business Security installation folder:
Uninstall Apache 2.0.59 from the Add/Remove Programs screen.
Install Apache 2.0.54.
Launch apache.msi from \PCCSRV\Admin\Utility\Apache.
In the Destination Folder screen, change the destination folder by clicking change and browsing to \PCCSRV.
Copy the backup files back to the Apache2 folder.
Restart the Apache service.
A plug-in program cannot be launched if the automatic configuration script setting on Internet Explorer redirects the address 127.0.0.1 through a proxy server.
Plug-in Manager on the Agent is unable to launch a plug-in program successfully because the program launch command redirects to a proxy server. This problem only occurs if the proxy setting redirects the user's HTTP traffic to 127.0.0.1.
Use a well-defined proxy server policy. For example, do not reroute HTTP traffic to 127.0.0.1.
If you need to use the proxy configuration that controls the 127.0.0.1 HTTP requests, do the following:
Configure Worry-Free Business Security firewall settings on the Web console.
Note: Perform this step if you enable the Worry-Free Business Security firewall on Agents.
Name: Your preferred name
Action: Allow network traffic
Direction: Inbound
Protocol: TCP
Port(s): A port number between 5000 and 49151
IP address(es): One of the following:
Select Single IP address and specify your proxy server's IP address (recommended)
Select All IP addresses
Refer to the Worry-Free Business Security documentation for more information.
Open the ofcscan.ini file in \PCCSRV using a text editor.
Search for [Global Setting] and add &quot;FWPortNum=21212&quot; to the next line. Change the &quot;21212&quot; value to the port number you specified in step c above.

Use Login Script Setup to automate the installation of the Security Agent on unprotected computers when they log on to the domain. Login Script Setup adds a program called autopcc.exe to the server login script. The program autopcc.exe performs the following functions:
Determines the operating system of the unprotected computer and the Security Agent
In order to enforce the use of login script installation method, clients must be listed in the Windows Active Directory of the server that is performing the installation.
If you already have an existing login script for Windows Server 2003/Server 2008, Login Script Setup will append a command that executes autopcc.exe; otherwise, it creates a batch file called ofcscan.bat (contains the command to run autopcc.exe).
{Server_name} is the computer name or IP address of the computer where the Trend Micro Security Server is installed.
If the environment cannot resolve server names by DNS, replace {Server_name} with {Server_IP_Address}.
The Server 2003 login script is on the Server 2003 server (through a net logon shared directory), under:
To add autopcc.exe to the login script using Login Script Setup:
On the computer where you installed WFBS, open C:\Program Files\Trend Micro\Security Server\PCCSRV\Admin\SetupUsr.exe. The Login Script Setup utility loads. The console displays a tree showing all domains on your network.
Browse for the Windows Server 2003/Server 2008 computer whose login script you want to modify, select it, and then click Select. The server must be a primary domain controller and you must have Administrator access.
Click OK. The Login Script Setup utility will return to its initial screen.
To modify the login scripts of other servers, repeat steps 2 to 4
To close Login Script Setup, click Exit
When an unprotected computer logs on to the servers whose login scripts you modified, autopcc.exe will automatically install the Agent to it.

If you thoroughly understand how Windows works, you can also choose to adjust other autostart settings.
The system registry contains all of your Windows and program settings.
Sometimes they can even prevent you from installing applications or starting Windows.
Internet privacy
Websites use small text files called cookies to provide you with customized content or services.
However, someone could also use this information to identify your computer and analyze what you view on the Internet.
To help protect your privacy, PC Health Checkup can delete cookies and browser history entries.
To help prevent spyware from gathering information about your computer, PC Health Checkup can delete lists of files recently opened by Windows, Microsoft Office software, media players, Windows search, and other programs.
To help maintain your privacy online, PC Health Checkup can remove chat histories, recent screen names, lists of files downloaded, transaction logs, and other information generated when using Skype, Yahoo!
The problem most likely resulted from your computer having problems connecting with the Internet.

For example, you cannot restore deleted files, cookies, or browser history entries.
Always keep Windows System Restore enabled while performing a check up in case you want to undo any changes made to your system settings.
PC Health Checkup optimizes your computer's performance and helps protect your privacy on the Internet by checking for security vulnerabilities, finding ways to reduce startup time and recover disk space, cleaning up the system registry, and removing web browser cookies and history entries.
The system registry is a database of settings used by Microsoft Windows and other programs.
Check your Internet connection by trying to open a website.
If you cannot open any websites, check your Internet cable or wireless Internet connection for any obvious problems.
If you access the Internet through a proxy server, make sure to enter the proxy server information in Microsoft Internet Explorer.

Why can't I scan my Google+ account?
Privacy Scanner can only check your Google+ profile for privacy concerns, not your Google account.
If you keep seeing the Once the Google+ site opens again automatically, please leave it open to scan the settings message, you can probably solve the problem by following these recommendations:
You have created a Google+ profile, and not just a Google account.
Your computer can connect to the Internet.
Make sure that your computer can connect to the Internet.
The file becomes locked by OneDrive, possibly because it is open in another program
Most of the time, you can simply scan your OneDrive again to have the Cloud Storage Scanner resolve these threats.

Why should I update Adobe Acrobat Reader and Java?
Adobe and Oracle regularly release updates that fix problems and close security loopholes in Adobe Acrobat Reader and Java, so updating them can prevent attackers from taking advantage of known weaknesses.

Windows User Accounts
Customized rules for Parental Controls rely on Windows User Accounts.
Microsoft Windows allows you to create unique accounts (with a user name and password) for each person using the computer.
You can link these accounts to the Parental Controls, and then set up different filtering and access schedules for each one.
The Parental Controls only recognize Windows User Accounts created on the computer, and do not work with Windows Domain accounts.

Data Miners This category of software (which may include web browser cookies) can monitor, analyze, and collect specific information, often for the benefit ofcompanies researching their customers.
Network Virus Network viruses use computer email and network protocols, such as TCP, FTP, UDP, and HTTP, to copy themselves onto other computers.

More sinister forms of spyware collect private financial information, send junk mail through your Internet connection, or force the host computer to participate in attacks against computer networks.

Updates from Trend Micro may allow Trend Micro Titanium to remove malicious software that it could not treat before, so have a little patienceif the first attempt does not succeed.
You should only click Restore after successfully cleaning a quarantined file.Once released from the quarantine, even malicious software that cannot harm your Mac could transmit itself to a more vulnerable computer.

How Titanium scans compressed files
Unfortunately, malicious software can easily hide inside compressed files, so Trend Micro Titanium must take extra precautions when dealing with them.
Upon finding a compressed file, Trend Micro Titanium will first try to unpack its contents and scan the files inside.
If it finds more compressed files within the first one, Trend Micro Titanium will unpack those as well.
Because these files more often pose a risk, you should make Trend Micro Titanium quarantine or delete compressed files that it cannot scan or clean.
For example, suppose a compressed file called pets.zip contains cats.doc, dogs.zip, birds.doc, and fish.doc.
In this case, dogs.zip is also a compressed file containing beagles.doc and poodles.doc.
When considering the entire pets.zip file, cats.doc, dogs.zip, birds.doc, and fish.doc are in the "first layer" of compression. beagles.doc and poodles.doc are in the "second layer" of compression, hidden inside dogs.zip.
Trend Micro Titanium can find malicious software lurking inside multiple layers of compressed files.
Trend Micro Titanium can check the following types of compressed files:
.ACE - created by WinAce archiver
.ARJ - ARJ compressed archive
.BIN - MacBinary encoded file or CD image
.BZ2 - UNIX BZip2 compressed file
.CAB - Microsoft cabinet file
.EML -Microsoft Outlook Email file
.GZ; .GZIP - UNIX or GNU ZIP archive
.HQX - Macintosh BinHex encoded file
.LHA - LHarc compressed archive
.MHT - Multipurpose Internet mail HTML file (web archive file)
.RAR - compressed file created by WinRAR
.TAR - backup tape archive
.TD0 - Teledisk disk image
.UU - UU-encoded data file
.Z -UNIX compressed archive
.ZIP - compressed file created by PKzip or 7-zip
Trend Micro Titanium keeps records of what it has done to protect you.
Scan Results Here you can see all of the malicious software that Trend Micro Titanium has found on your Mac.Along with the name of each threat, you can find out how, when, and where Trend Micro Titanium found it, as well as what was done about it.
Unsafe Websites Found This list shows all of the unsafe websitesthat Trend Micro Titanium has prevented you from opening.
For each website, you can see the security rating that made Trend Micro Titanium block it, and when that happened.
Websites Filtered Here you can see all of the websites that Trend Micro Titanium has blocked based on categoriesselected in the website filter.
For each website, you can see which category caused Trend Micro Titanium to block it and why, as well as when that happened.
Updates Received This list shows all of theTrend Micro Titanium components that have been updated.
Trend Micro Titanium maintains these records until you empty a particular list.
Using this information, Trend Micro Titanium can sort the websites thatyou try to open into one of the categories below.
Based on the Web Threat Protection settings you have selected, Titanium can then prevent you from opening risky or dangerous pages.
Safe/Trusted Websites that pose no known or potential security risk fall into this category, and Trend Micro Titanium normally would not stop you from opening them.
Titanium can still block anywebsite based on a website filtering category, even if the site does not pose a security risk.Trend Micro Titanium will also block any website on the list of blocked websites, whether or not the site is considered "safe."
Trend Micro Titanium blocks websites in this category if you set the web threat detection slider to Normal or High .
Trend Micro Titanium will always block any websites in this category , evenif you set the web threat detection slider to Low.
Not Yet Rated Trend Micro has not yet tested this page for malicious software or signs of fraud, or it may use an unsupported protocol (something other than HTTP or HTTPS).
No Response Trend Micro Titanium cannot contact the page rating system.
Check your Internet connection and proxy server settings..
What Titanium does when it finds a threat
Trend Micro Titanium can respond to malicious software in four different ways.
Clean In many cases,Trend Micro Titanium can remove malicious software, like computer viruses, from files where it was hidden.
You should always let Trend Micro Titanium try to clean unsafe files.
Trend Micro Titanium cannot clean these files, and must isolate them instead.
Trend Micro Titanium will also quarantine currently uncleanable files that might become possible to disinfect later.
Delete Trend Micro Titanium can almost alwaysclean or quarantine malicious software successfully.
Only if unable to clean or quarantine a very risky form of malicious software will Trend Micro Titanium try to delete the file instead.
Ignore If unable to clean, quarantine, or delete the malicious software,Trend Micro Titanium will just make a record of the threat in the logs.
How to prevent Titanium from scanning certain files
None of the scans offered by Trend Micro Titanium will check anything added to this list, which can hold a maximum of 512 files and file types.
Trend Micro Titanium does not allow "wildcard" characters (like "." or ":") when you enter a file type.
The different ways to scan your Mac
Trend Micro Titanium can protect you with three major kinds of scans:
Real-time Scanning This feature checks for malicious software whenever your Mac receives, opens, downloads, copies, or modifies a file.You should always keep this feature enabled.
"On-Demand" Scanning You can make Trend Micro Titanium scan some or all of the files on your Mac whenever you want.
The time needed to finish this kind of scan depends on the number of files involved and the specifications of your Mac.
Scheduled Scanning You can set a schedule for Trend Micro Titanium to check some or all of the files on your Mac.
Custom Scan This kind of scan checks specific files or the contents of folders on your Mac that you choose.
Full Scan This kind of scan checks every file on your Mac for malicious software.
Trend Micro Titanium will first try to remove (or "clean") any malicious software found during a scan.
If unable to remove the malicious software, Trend Micro Titanium will quarantine the file.
In rare cases when Trend Micro Titanium cannot clean or quarantine the malicious software,Trend Micro Titanium will delete the file instead.
You can change how Trend Micro Titanium will respond to malicious software in the Scan Settings window.
The different levels of protection for your Mac
You can select from three levels of protection that determine how strictly Trend Micro Titanium will block access to risky or unsafe websites.
Low Trend Micro Titanium will only block websites verified as dangerous.
Normal Trend Micro Titanium will block websites that have characteristics associated with online fraud, or that show signs of transmitting malicious software.
High Trend Micro Titanium blocks all websites stopped by the previous levels.

OfficeScan displays an alert message on infected clients when it detects a virus or an intrusion. \n\nYou can use the default message or compose a new message. If you do not want to display any alert message, delete the messages below.
OfficeScan Client Deployment Methods
OfficeScan provides several methods for deploying the client software to the computers on your network. Some of these methods are automatic and runs in the background, while others require user intervention.
1. Login Script Setup - modify your system login script to automatically deploy the client software.\n\n2. Web Deployment - install the client software via a Web page on your corporate intranet.
3. NT Remote Installation - deploy the client software remotely to Windows NT workstations throughout your company with Windows NT Remote Install.
4. Microsoft SMS - deploy the client software using Microsoft's System Management Server on a Windows NT 4.0 platform.
OfficeScan Deployment Planner
With the Deployment Planner, the administrator can configure OfficeScan's security risk protection level and assign users to specific domains even before the client software is deployed to the workstations.
These settings are stored in the OfficeScan database and are automatically applied to clients once they are installed.\n\nTo open the Deployment Planner utility, click Deployment Planner. Click Next to continue.
OfficeScan Server Types
OfficeScan has two types of servers: HTTP-based server and file-based server. The type of server you should install depends on your network environment and operating system. To decide which server to install, determine the following:
1. Do your client workstations support TCP/IP communication?\n\n2. Is the machine where you plan to install the OfficeScan server running Windows NT 4.0 with Microsoft IIS 3.0 or above?
If you answered Yes to both questions, then you may install the HTTP-based server. If you answered No to one or both questions, you must install the file-based server.
Type the domain/host name or IP address of the target server (e.g., 'TMCM.trendmicro.com' or '123.123.123.123') and the port number you want to assign to OfficeScan.\n\nClick Next to continue.
Click Finish to complete the installation.
&amp;Open the Cisco ICS Web console

HTTP-based OfficeScan server\n\nYou must first share a directory on the target server.\n\nSupported platforms:\nWindows 2000/NT Server with IIS 4.0 or later
There are two types of OfficeScan server. Select the type of server that you want to install. Click Next to continue.
File-based OfficeScan server\n\nYou must first map a drive to a shared directory on the target server. \n\nSupported platforms:\nNovell NetWare 4.0 or later,\nWindows 2000, Windows NT 4.0
Deploying the OfficeScan client software via login script requires the server login scripts to be modified. You must therefore have administrator rights to modify the server login scripts.
&amp;Login Script Setup
The Login Script Setup utility automatically makes the required login script changes. It can be used on both Windows NT and Novell NetWare servers.\n\nTo start Login Script Setup, click Login Script Setup. Click Next to continue.
Setup has created a shared folder named 'OFCSCAN' in C:\Program Files\Trend Micro\TMCM\PCCSRV.
All subfolders under the PCCSRV folder are shared to all users on your network. This will allow your clients to write virus log information and configuration data to these subfolders.
Web Deployment Setup
Deployment via the Web browser
OfficeScan has set up a Web page on this server. When a user visits this Web page using Microsoft Internet Explorer, ActiveX controls will be activated and will install the OfficeScan client program.

Login Script Setup automates the installation of the OfficeScan client to unprotected computers when they log on to the network. Login Script Setup adds a program called Autopcc.exe to the server login script.
AutoPcc.exe performs the following functions:
Determines the operating system of the unprotected computer and installs the appropriate version of the OfficeScan client
Identify which computers on your network do not currently have protection against security risks. You can do this by running the Trend Micro Vulnerability Scanner. This tool analyzes computers on your network for installed antivirus software based on an IP address range you specify.
To add AutoPcc.exe to the login script using Login Script Setup:
On the computer you used to run the server installation, click Programs &amp;gt; Trend Micro OfficeScan Server- {Server Name} &amp;gt; Login Script Setup from the Windows Start menu.
Locate the server whose login script you want to modify, select it, and then click Select. The server must be a primary domain controller and you must have administrator access. Login Script Setup prompts you for a user name and password.
Click OK. Login Script Setup returns to its initial screen.
Note: AutoPcc.exe will automatically install the OfficeScan client to an unprotected computer when it logs on to the server whose login scripts you modified.
If you already have an existing login script, OfficeScan appends a command that executes AutoPcc.exe. Otherwise, OfficeScan creates a batch file called ofcscan.bat that contains the command to run AutoPcc.exe.
OfficeScan appends the following at the end of the login script:
is the name or IP address of the OfficeScan server computer
ofcscan is the OfficeScan directory on the server
autopcc is the link to the to the AutoPcc executable file that will install the OfficeScan client
Windows 2000 server: \\Windows 2000 server\system drive\WINNT\SYSVOL\domain\scripts\ofcscan.bat

Powered by the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network, product_name_trademarked is a centrally managed anti-malware solution that protects computer_device_plural (servers, desktops, and portable devices) from a wide variety of Internet threats.
An integrated solution, product_name consists of the trend_client_program_single that resides at the computer_device and the product_short_name server that manages all trend_client_program_plural.
About Trend Micro Remote Manager
The Trend Micro Remote Manager allows resellers to manage WFBS-SVC remotely.
See the TMRM documentation or talk to your reseller for details.
To protect your endpoints from the latest security risks, the Security Agent regularly and automatically receives component updates.
By default, the Security Agent updates hourly.
product_short_name provides an update method that helps save network bandwidth and increase update efficiency.
When the Security Agent finds a new update from Trend Micro ActiveUpdate, the Security Agent checks if any Security Agent from the same network has already installed the update and takes one of the following actions accordingly:
At least one Security Agent from the same network has already installed the latest update
The Security Agent downloads the latest update from the other Security Agent.
None of the Security Agents has received the latest update
The Security Agent downloads the latest update from Trend Micro ActiveUpdate.
The update method only applies to Windows Security Agents.
Security Agents running other operating systems receive updates directly from Trend Micro ActiveUpdate.
If the Security Agent does not connect to other Security Agents via a local area network (LAN), the Security Agent will receive updates from Trend Micro ActiveUpdate instead.
Open trend_client_program_single_cap Console
Exit trend_client_program_single_cap
Check the Internet connection and update the Security Agents again.
Antivirus - Real-Time Scan disabled
Mobile device management commands - Incomplete
Mobile device management commands - Pending
Active Directory synchronization - Unsuccessful
Upload a new certificate in MOBILEENROLLMENU and re-enroll all iOS devices.
Check that all Security Agents can connect to the Internet.
If the problem persists after confirming that all Security Agents can connect to the Internet, contact your support representative.
Update: Deployment rate less than %threshold% after one hour of pattern release
Active Directory Settings Task Conrefs
Go to AdministrationActive Directory Settings.
To only export information on active computers, select Exclude computers that have not logged on for N days and specify a number between 30 and 999.
product_short_name allows you to manage Security Agents using the Active Directory (AD) organizational unit (OU) structure.
You can set up automatic synchronization with your Active Directory structure using the Trend Micro Common Active Directory Synchronization Tool, or import the Active Directory structure manually.
If your Active Directory structure contains multiple domains, only add the domains that communicate through port 389 when you configure Active Directory settings on product_short_name.
Adding the domain that communicates through port 3268 places Security Agents in the default folders in the Device Tree and prevents you from managing Security Agents based on your Active Directory structure.
Importing LDIF File
Importing Active Directory Structure Manually
Before product_name can organize your Security Agents using the Active Directory structure, you must export the Active Directory structure to an LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF) file and import the file into theproduct_name web console.
product_name does not maintain an active connection with the Active Directory server.
Any changes made to Active Directory are not automatically synchronized.
If you make changes to the Active Directory structure, you must export and re-import the structure into the product_name web console.
To set up the Active Directory settings in the product_name web console, perform the following steps:
The Security Agent might take the "Clean" action on certain Trojan horse programs instead of the default action.
Create manual groups to collectively manage multiple Security Agents.
All Security Agents must be associated with a group and cannot reside outside of a group.
Name: Specify a unique name for the new group.
Go to newfiltermenu .

Download the Security Agent installer as described in .
Place the Security Agent installer (WFBS-SVC_Agent_Installer.msi) into a folder (for example, D:\share) on one of your servers (for example, MYFILESERVER).
Share the folder (D:\share) using permissions so that everyone can access this folder and the Security Agent installer.
Open the example script (WFBS-SVC Example Deployment Script.vbs) with an editor.
Modify the first line from pathOfWFBSHInstaller="msiexec /qn /i ""WFBS-SVC_Agent_Installer.msi""" to the path of your environment, for example pathOfWFBSHInstaller="msiexec /qn /i ""\\MYFILESERVER\share\WFBS-SVC_Agent_Installer.msi""".
Set the Windows startup script to the path where you put the script, for example \\MYFILESERVER\share\WFBS-SVC Example Deployment Script.vbs (The user logon script is not used because the user may not have the necessary permission to install software).
For more information on how to set up a Windows startup script in Windows domain controller, see the following:
Security Agent Installation — Download Installer
Use this method to download the .msi file and install the Security Agent on a single endpoint or on multiple endpoints.
Copy the installer to each endpoint and run the installer to install the Security Agent.

Install the Security Agent on endpoints that are in a different group and account from the endpoint used to download the Security Agent installer.
Security Agent Installation — Send Installer Link
Sending users the link to download the installation package is a convenient way to deploy Security Agents.
Users must have a compatible browser with the security level set to allow cookies to successfully download the installation package.
The Security Agent uses the proxy settings in Internet Explorer under Tools > Internet Options > Connections > LAN Settings to access the Internet.
Microsoft Edge users need to go to Settings > Network & Internet > Proxy >.
Under Manual proxy setup, turn on Use a proxy server, and then type the proxy server address and port number.
Firefox users need to ensure the browser uses system proxy settings available under Tools > Options > Advanced > Network > Settings.
If you are a reseller, you must log into each company that you are administering separately to either obtain the download URL for distribution via email or to download the Security Agent installer for conventional or scripted installation.
If you use the wrong URL or Security Agent installer, the Security Agent will show up under the wrong customer and will have to be reinstalled using the correct installer.
(Optional) Click Configure link expiration to set an expiration time on the Security Agent installation package and the email link if the user does not take action.
Download Installer — Different Group and Account Installation
Use the Identifier to install the Security Agent on multiple Windows endpoints that are in a different group and account as the endpoint used to download the installer package.
Instead of downloading multiple copies of the installer, the same .msi file can be used with different Identifiers when installing on different endpoints.
For example, pathOfWFBSHInstaller="msiexec /qn /i ""WFBS-SVC_Agent_Installer.msi"" IDENTIFIER=""Your_Identifier""".

product_short_name provides color themes for the web console.
Security Agent Deployment Options
product_short_name provides multiple options to deploy Security Agents.
For single-site deployment, IT administrators can choose to deploy using a Login Script Setup.
The Agent is deployed in the background and the end user does not notice the installation process.
In organizations where IT policies are strictly enforced Login Script Setup is recommended.
Login-script setups do not require administrative privileges to be assigned to the end user.
In organizations where IT policies are less strictly enforced, Agent/Profile installation using simple Agent download is recommended.
The administrator sends out an email message instructing users to visit the download site where they can install the Agent.
Using this method, however, requires that end users who will install the Agent have administrator privileges.
In organizations that also have Macs in the environment, Agent installation using the email link is recommended.
The administrator sends out an email message instructing users to visit the download site where they can install Agent.
The same package cannot be used on a different Mac.
In organizations also have Android devices in the environment, Agent installation using product_short_name is recommended.
Users download the Agent from product_short_name and use the authentication code they receive from the administrator to enroll the device and activate the agent.
Before deploying Security Profiles to iOS devices, administrators must first create a valid Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) certificate.
Full version: Comes with technical support, virus pattern downloads, real-time scanning, and program updates.

An End User License Agreement, or EULA, is a legal contract between a software publisher and the software user.
Many users inadvertently agree to the installation of spyware/grayware and other types of grayware into their devices when they click "I accept" on EULA prompts displayed during the installation of certain free software.
A false positive occurs when a website, URL or "infected" file is incorrectly determined by filtering software to be of an unwanted type.
For example, a legitimate email between colleagues may be detected as spam if a job-seeking filter does not distinguish between resume (to start again) and résumé (a summary of work experience).
The main screen or dashboard of the Web Console.
Privileges (agent privileges)
From the web console, Administrators can set privileges for the Agents.
End users can then set the Agents to scan their clients according to the privileges you allowed.
Use agent privileges to enforce a uniform antivirus policy throughout your organization.
TrendLabs is Trend Micro's global network of antivirus research and product support centers that provide 24 x 7 coverage to Trend Micro customers around the world.
When set to IntelliScan, the Client/Server Security Agent will confirm a file's true type by opening the file header and checking its internally registered data type.
The scan engine works together with the virus pattern file to perform the first level of detection, using a process called pattern matching, to identify viruses and other Internet threats.
The web console is a centralized web-based management console.
You use it to configure the settings of Agents which protect all your devices.
The product_short_name Server communicates with Agents installed on clients.
The product_short_name Server also hosts the web console, the centralized web-based management console for the entire product_short_name solution.

Incorrect Number of Endpoints on the Web Console
You may see that the number of endpoints displayed on the web console is incorrect.
This happens if you retain endpoint records in the database after uninstalling the Security Agent.
For example, if endpoint-server communication is lost while uninstalling the Security Agent, the server does not receive notifications about the uninstallation.
The server retains endpoint records in the database and still shows the endpoint information on the web console.
When you reinstall the Security Agent, the server creates a new record in the database and on the web console.

To view the version number for the most current version of the scan engine, visit the Trend Micro website(
Originally developed in response to early file-based viruses, the scan engine today is exceptionally sophisticated and capable of detecting Internet worms, mass mailers, Trojan horse threats, phishing sites, and network exploits as well as viruses.
Actively circulating: Threats that are actively circulating on the Internet
Known and controlled: Controlled viruses not in circulation, but that are developed and used for research
If the Agent detects a virus, it can remove it and restore the integrity of the file.
The scan engine is able to decrypt all major encryption formats (including MIME and BinHex).
It recognizes and scans common compression formats, including ZIP, ARJ, and CAB.
The Agent can also scan multiple layers of compression within a file (maximum of six).
Upgrades to the engine software prompted by a change in the nature of virus threats, such as a rise in mixed threats like SQL Slammer
The Trend Micro scan engine is certified annually by international computer security organizations, including ICSA (International Computer Security Association)
Since each virus contains a unique signature or string of tell-tale characters that distinguish it from any other code, the virus experts at TrendLabs capture inert snippets of this code in the pattern file.
product_short_name provides the following scan types to protect endpoints from Internet threats.
A persistent and ongoing scan available on Windows, Mac, and Android
On Windows and Mac, each time a file is received, opened, downloaded, copied, or modified, Real-Time Scan scans the file for threats.
On Android mobile devices, Real-Time Scan scans apps as they are installed.
During a Normal Scan, Security Agents take actions against threats according to the actions set by the administrator or user.
To reduce performance impact, configure the CPU Usage section in Manual Scan settings.
Similar to Manual Scan but scans specified files at the configured time and frequency on Windows and Mac.

Trend Micro Remote Manager access permissions are configured in Licensing Management Platform.
Once your Administrator grants your Remote Manager access permissions in Licensing Management Platform, Remote Manager automatically retrieves your role settings when you sign in to the console.
Your role also corresponds to a related role in Worry-Free Business Security Services.
If you have access to the Worry-Free Business Security Services console from Remote Manager, Worry-Free Business Security Services automatically retrieves your role settings when you sign in to the console.
This section helps you troubleshoot issues that may arise while using the product_short_name web console and Security Agent.
Agent Icon Does Not Appear After Installation
Do I have the latest pattern file or service pack
How can I perform a mass deployment to Mac
Uninstalling the Security Agent leaves the endpoint unprotected from the latest security risks.
Use this tool to uninstall the Security Agent from Mac.
Under Uninstaller for Mac, click the download link.
Go to the Mac from which you want to uninstall the Security Agent.
This pattern stays in the Smart Scan Server and is used when responding to scan queries received from trend_client_program_plural.
trend_client_program_plural that cannot determine the risk of the file during the scan verify the risk by sending a scan query to the Scan Server.
Ensure that Security Agents are up to date with the latest components to stay protected from the latest threats.
As soon as you install the Security Agent, all components are immediately updated.
Security Agents then automatically update components according to the following update times:
Windows: Every hour
Mac: Every hour
Android: Every 24 hours
You can view this information by clicking the Update: Deployment rate less than %threshold% after two hours of pattern release event in the Action Center.

User roles define the features that a user can access on the product_short_name web console.
Click an account name and click the Remove button to remove the user account from the product_short_name web console.
Each time a user logs on to a protected endpoint, product_short_name associates the endpoint with the user account allowing you to monitor and assess the activity of specific users.
product_short_name associates endpoints with the last logged on user account.
For example, when User A logs on to Endpoint X, product_short_name associates Endpoint X with User A in the list.
If User B then logs on to Endpoint X, product_short_name moves Endpoint X to User B in the list.
If multiple endpoints all use the default Administrator account, product_short_name may display a long list of endpoints as being associated with the Administrator account.
The Active Directory domain of the user account
Domain information is only available if you have Active Directory integration with product_short_name and the logon user used an Active Directory account to log on to a protected endpoint.
product_short_name automatically removes user accounts from the list if the account no longer has associated endpoints and has no detection logs.

Security Agent Deployment and Upgrade
When the following conditions apply, the proxy server information needs to be added to the firewall exception list in the Worry-Free Business Security Services web console.
Endpoints are installed on Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, or later and use a proxy server.
The firewall security level is set to High in the advanced mode in the Worry-Free Business Security Services web console.
Users cannot deploy the Security Agent program when Internet Explorer 10 or later is running in Metro mode on Windows 8 or later.
The email installation link does not work properly when users try to re-activate the Security Agent using Microsoft Edge. However, Microsoft intends to resolve this issue in a later release.
After users install the Security Agent and then open Firefox, sometimes the Firefox extension installation process does not start. Users need to manually enable the extension in Add-ons Manager.
If the Security Agent is enabled and a malware program resides in the Security Agent folder before Real-time Scan starts, the Security Agent cannot restrict that malware from updating the registry.
On Windows 10 endpoints, Worry-Free Business Security Services alerts may be hidden behind the Microsoft Edge browser window. Users must check for any unauthorized event or threat alerts that may appear.
If the Security Agent is installed on a Windows endpoint running Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET), there might be some performance and conflict issues. Trend Micro recommends not installing the Security Agent and Microsoft EMET on the same endpoint.
Issue: If users have installed Windows Update KB3076895 (MS15-084), the Msxml6.dll 6.20.5008.0 file included in the update might cause issues in the TmListen.exe service and policy setting deployments.
Workaround: Install Windows Update KB3092627 or later to update the Msxml6.dll file.
When multiple logon sessions exist on an endpoint, some agent process files might crash after an agent upgrade. Users might need to manually start the Security Agent.
The Security Agent firewall may conflict with other firewall applications. Trend Micro recommends uninstalling or disabling other firewall applications.
To address this issue, add the following value to the VMware client registry:
The firewall feature does not support IPv6.
When running Internet Explorer 9 or later with Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration, the Web Reputation plug-in module (TmIEPlugInBHO Class) cannot be automatically applied. Risky URLs using SSL cannot be blocked.
Web Reputation Services and URL Filtering are not supported when Internet Explorer 10 or later is running in Metro mode on Windows 8 or later.
Issue: If Chrome is open while the Security Agent updates Web Reputation Services and URL Filtering components, the Security Agent will not be able to block HTTPS websites.
Workaround: Restart Chrome to resolve the issue.
HTTPS Web Threat Protection does not support Mac Security Agents.
Windows Small Business Server Dashboard Add-In Tool
Dashboard Add-in is not compatible with Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration. Ensure this option is disabled before opening the Dashboard.
Endpoints installed on Windows Vista or later and have User Account Control (UAC) enabled cannot run automatic installation.
Multiple log entries appear when a user tries to access or copy files to a USB device. Device Control detects each instance as a single policy violation but includes multiple entries in the logs to differentiate the OS versions.
Device Control supports all 32-bit operating systems and only the following 64-bit platforms: Windows Vista SP1 x64 and later.
When users block an application that consists of .dll files only, Worry-Free Business Security Services will not block the application. Blocking the .dll files might also block other applications that run the same .dll files.
When using HTML tags that might be exploited by Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks to search in the Certified Safe Software List, the search function ignores the tags to prevent script injections.
When multiple logon sessions exist on an endpoint, the Application Control feature will increase CPU usage for a while.
BitLocker cannot encrypt endpoints that run multiple operating systems when users install Windows 7 first and then install Windows 10. In this scenario, the default system partition size on both operating systems will be 100 MB, but BitLocker requires at least 350 MB of system partition size on Windows 10.
When uninstalling the Security Agent with Data Loss Prevention enabled, users must restart the endpoints to completely remove the Data Loss Prevention components. Currently there is no reminder of the requirement.
If users try to reinstall the Security Agent without restarting the endpoints, the Data Loss Prevention components cannot be installed until users restart the endpoints. After reinstalling the Data Loss Prevention components, users must restart the endpoints again.
Data Loss Prevention cannot detect violations triggered from Google Backup and Sync that is version 3.42.9858.3671 or later.
The Security Agent does not support root accounts.
Issue: After upgrading from macOS Sierra (10.12) to macOS High Sierra (10.13), users must click the Allow button in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General within 30 minutes. Otherwise the button will disappear.
Worry-Free Business Security Services cannot be installed on rooted Android devices.
On an Android device, if the user goes to Settings > Apps > Worry-Free Security > Storage and taps CLEAR CACHE, the Security Agent might not be able to connect to the server to receive updates. The user would need to re-enroll the device.
If other installed apps interfere with the device's network connection, the Security Agent might not be able to connect to the server to receive updates.
When using the "Remote Locate" feature to find a mobile device, the language code (for example: en, jp, fr) that displays in the browser for the embedded Google Maps may not be the same as the language used by the web console.
Worry-Free Business Security Services uses Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) for Android mobile device management commands. Commands sent to Android devices can take some time to be received, or the commands may be unsuccessful.
For Android devices that contain multiple user profiles, the Security Agent can only be installed in the owner's profile. An error occurs when users try to install the Security Agent in other user profiles.
Worry-Free Business Security Services uses the Apple Push Notification service (APNs) for iOS mobile device management commands. Commands sent to iOS devices can take some time to be received, or the commands may be unsuccessful.
If the Private Browsing feature in Safari is enabled ( iOS devices may not successfully complete device enrollment.
Users cannot install the Security Profile when the iOS device uses a proxy server to connect to the Internet.

If users click the web console URL in an email notification without signing into the web console first, users are redirected to the Sign In screen. After signing in, users have to click the web console URL in the email notification again to be redirected to the log events screen.
Worry-Free Business Security Services cannot block some applications if users execute the applications using "Run as administrator".
Issue: Once the Worry-Free Business Security Services license has expired, BitLocker automatically triggers the decryption process on managed endpoints. If the endpoints happen to be in Suspended or Locked status, BitLocker cannot decrypt the endpoints.
Workaround: Resume BitLocker protection or unlock the endpoint, and then uninstall the Security Agent to trigger the decryption process again.
The "JavaScript Required" screen cannot display in Google Chrome. Users must click the Submit button on the screen to see the content.
The Security Agents screen cannot display the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth MAC addresses of Android 7.0 devices.

Conref - Creating a New Policy
For more information about configuring policy settings for specific managed products, see the Control Manager Widget and Policy Management Guide.
control_manager_prod provides several target selection methods that affect how a policy works.
To include a managed product or endpoint as a target, make sure the product version of the managed product or endpoint supports policy management in control_manager_prod.
None (Draft only): Use this option to save the policy as a draft without choosing any targets.
For certain product settings, control_manager_prod needs to obtain specific setting options from the managed products.
If administrators select multiple targets for a policy, control_manager_prod can only obtain the setting options from the first selected target.
If you are creating a policy for OfficeScan Agent that you want to act as a parent to a future child policy, configure settings that can be inherited, customized, or extended on the child policy.
If you clicked Deploy,control_manager_prod starts the deployment.
It usually takes a few minutes for control_manager_prod to deploy the policy to the targets.
Check if there is a connection between control_manager_prod and the targets.
Once control_manager_prod deploys a policy to the targets, the settings defined in the policy overwrite the existing settings in the targets.
control_manager_prod enforces the policy settings in the targets every 24 hours.
Although local administrators can make changes to the settings from the managed product console, the changes are overwritten every time control_manager_prod enforces the policy settings.
control_manager_prod enforces the policy settings on the targets every 24 hours.
Since policy enforcement only occurs every 24 hours, the product settings in the targets may not align with the policy settings if local administrators make changes through the managed product console between the enforcement period.
Policy settings deployed to IMSVA servers take priority over the existing settings on the target servers instead of overwriting them.
IMSVA servers save these policy settings on the top of the list.
If an OfficeScan agent assigned with a control_manager_prod policy has been moved to another OfficeScan domain, the agent settings will temporarily change to the ones defined by that OfficeScan domain.
Once control_manager_prod enforces the policy again, the agent settings will comply with the policy settings.

Conref - User Roles
User roles define which areas of the control_manager_prod web console a user can access and control.
You can use this screen to create and edit custom control_manager_prod user roles.
If a custom user role in a previous control_manager_prod version has permissions to Policy Management menu items, the role will have full control permissions after upgrading to the current release.
When upgrading from a control_manager_prod version that does not include Policy Management, custom user roles have no permissions to manage or view Policy Management features until you choose to modify the role settings.
Only the Root, Administrator, and Administrator and DLP Compliance Officer accounts can add or edit user roles.
You cannot delete any of the default user roles provided by company_name_product_name.
You cannot edit any of the default user roles provided by company_name_product_name.
Managed product information displayed on accessible menu items depends on the managed product/directory permissions that control_manager_prod administrators specify in an individual's user account.
When administrators specify which products a user can access, the administrator is also specifying what information a user can access from control_manager_prod.
Bob and Jane are OfficeScan administrators.
Both have identical user role permissions (they have access to the same menu items in the web console).
However, Jane oversees operations for all OfficeScan servers.
Bob only oversees operations for OfficeScan servers protecting desktops for the Marketing department.
The information that they can view in the web console will be very different.
Bob logs on and only sees information that is applicable to the OfficeScan servers that his control_manager_prod user account allows (the OfficeScan servers for the Marketing department).
When Jane logs on, she sees information for all OfficeScan servers, because her control_manager_prod user account grants her access to all OfficeScan servers registered to control_manager_prod.

Assessing Impact and Responding to IOCs
After obtaining properly formatted IOC files from a trusted external source (a security forum or other Deep Discovery Virtual Analyzer product), import the file to control_manager_prod to determine if the threat exists within your network and take mitigation steps to prevent the spread of the threat to other endpoints.
Impact assessment of external IOC data requires that Endpoint Sensor 1.5 (or later) is registered to control_manager_prod and installed on the target endpoints.
Endpoint isolation requires that you install OfficeScan 11.0 SP1 (or later) agents with the OfficeScan firewall enabled on the target endpoints.
The Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) screen appears.
Select the IOC file you want to use as the source of your investigation.
To start an investigation, select the IOC file from the list and click Assess Impact.
From the Target endpoints drop-down, select All, or Specific and type the endpoint names or IP addresses to investigate.
Use a new line to add multiple endpoint names or IP addresses.
The Indicators of Compromise > At Risk Endpoints screen appears.
You can perform a full or partial historical impact assessment of security threats in your environment on the Affected Users screen in control_manager_prod.
Deep Discovery Inspector assesses the impact of suspicious URLs, IP addresses, and domains based on historical network traffic information collected by Trend Micro Retro Scan.
Endpoint Sensor assesses the impact of suspicious files, IP addresses, and domains in your environment by contacting agents and performing a historical scan of the agent logs to determine if the suspicious objects have affected your environment for a period of time without detection.
Performing an impact assessment requires the following version of control_manager_prod:
control_manager_prod 7.0 (or later)
control_manager_prod requires at least one of the following products to perform an impact assessment.
Deep Discovery Inspector 3.8 (or later)
You must have Retro Scan enabled in Deep Discovery Inspector to perform the impact assessment.
On the control_manager_prod console, go to Dashboard.
On the Users with Threats or Endpoints with Threats widgets, click a number.
Deep Discovery Inspector and Endpoint Sensor (if available) scan historical network traffic and logs for any detections of the suspicious object.
Assessing Impact Using Endpoint Sensor
Endpoint Sensor contacts agents and performs a historical scan of the agent logs to determine if the suspicious objects have affected your environment for a period of time without detection.
Control Manager 7.0 (or later)
Endpoint Sensor 1.5 only provides information related to the File and IP address suspicious object types.
Endpoint Sensor 1.6 (or later) provides information related to the File, IP address, and Domain suspicious object types.
On the control_manager_prod console, go to AdministrationSuspicious ObjectsVirtual Analyzer Objects.
Endpoint Sensor contacts agents and evaluates the agent logs for any detections of the suspicious objects.
When a new endpoint registers to control_manager_prod, it goes through the filtered policies in the list in descending order.
control_manager_prod assigns the new endpoint to a filtered policy when the following conditions are both satisfied:
For endpoints just registered to control_manager_prod and for those just released from deleted policies, there is a three-minute grace period during which no endpoint allocation occurs.
control_manager_prod allocates these endpoints again when the following actions occur:
control_manager_prod uses a daily endpoint allocation schedule to ensure that endpoints are assigned to the correct policies.
This action occurs once at 3:15 pm every day.
When endpoint properties change, such as the operating system or IP address, these endpoints require the daily schedule to re-assign them to the correct policies.
When the above actions occur, control_manager_prod allocate endpoints based on the following conditions:
Assigning HTTPS Access to the Control Manager Web Console
During control_manager_prod installation you can choose the level of security when accessing the management console.
The least secure only requires an HTTP connection.
The most secure requires an HTTPS connection.
You must obtain a certificate and set up the control_manager_prod virtual directory before you can start sending encrypted or digitally signed information to and from a control_manager_prod server.
Obtain a Web Site Certificate from any certification provider (for example, Thawte.com or VeriSign.co).
Log on to the product_name server.
Click StartProgramsAdministrative ToolsInternet Services Manager to open the IIS Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

The next time you access the web console using HTTP, the following message appears:
product_short_name Administrators: Responsible for product_short_name installation, configuration, and management.
Managed Product Administrators: Users who manage company_name products that integrate with product_short_name.
The primary form of protection that Control Manager delivers is prevention of unauthorized user access to encrypted endpoints and devices.
Correctly configuring Control Manager devices, users, and policy groups prevents data loss risk from accidental information release or deliberate sabotage.
Control Manager counts the amount of consecutive logon attempts on a given device and the amount of time since the last communication with PolicyServer for a given length of time.
If a device violates the policy criteria, Control Manager can reset, lock, or erase the disk.
In addition to checking authentication attempts on a device, Control Manager also counts the amount of consecutive logon attempts by a particular user account.
If that user violates the policy criteria, Control Manager can reset, lock, or erase the disk.
control_manager_prod supports both SQL database authentication and Windows authentication.
Authorization Token Structure
You must create a properly defined JSON Web Token to successfully use Automation APIs.
The following tables outline the required information that you must include in the Header and Payload sections of the JWT token.
The algorithm used to calculate the JWT checksum
HS256 (HMAC SHA256)
The type of token
control_manager_prod only accepts JSON Web Tokens.
The Application ID of the third-party application obtained from the Automation API Access Settings screen
The Issued at token generation time
The generation time uses the Unix time stamp (number of seconds since Jan 01 1970 UTC) format.
The version of this authorization token
control_manager_prod only accepts V1.
To prevent a third-party from attempting to intercept and reuse the JWT token, you must configure a Communication time-out interval when adding applications to the Automation API Access Settings screen.
Upon receiving the API request, control_manager_prod compares the Issued at (iat) attribute to the time control_manager_prod received the request.
If the request did not arrive before the configured time-out interval, control_manager_prod rejects the request with a 401 response code.
The type of JSON Web Token (JWT)
control_manager_prod only accepts JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
The version of this JWT authorization token
control_manager_prod only accepts V1 JWT authorization tokens.

Components Update Status Widget
This widget displays a summary of the device update status of registered mobile devices.
After successfully setting up the Suspicious Object Hub and registering the Suspicious Object Node Control Manager servers, note the following configuration information.
After unregistering a Node Control Manager server, all previously synchronized objects remain in the Node Control Manager server suspicious object lists.
Node Control Manager
5 minutes (default)
From the Hub Control Manager to Nodes:
From a Node Control Manager to the Hub:
The Hub Control Manager server does not send data from the Notes column of the User-Defined list or the Exception list to the Node Control Manager servers.
If an object is added to both the User-Defined list and the Virtual Analyzer list on the Hub Control Manager before the next synchronization, the Hub Control Manager server deploys both lists to the Node Control Manager servers.
If an object in the Node Control Manager Virtual Analyzer list also exists in the Hub Control Manager User-Defined list, the suspicious object risk level changes to High on the Node Control Manager Virtual Analyzer list during the next synchronization.
Automatic synchronization of the Exception list from a migrated Control Manager 6.0 installation requires enabling Suspicious Object Hub and Node Control Manager architecture on the Control Manager 6.0 server prior to migration.
The Control Manager 7.0 installation preserves the Suspicious Object Hub and Node architecture from the migrated Control Manager 6.0 installation.
To enable Suspicious Object Hub and Node Control Manager architecture on the Control Manager 6.0 server before migration, locate the m_iTmcmSoDist_ForceSyncWhitelist tag in the SystemConfiguration.xml file and change the value to 1.
Configuring Suspicious Objects through the Hub Control Manager ensures consistency across the registered Node Control Manager servers.
To ensure that all the suspicious object lists on the Node Control Manager servers remain synchronized, do not perform any actions (for example, Add or Expire objects) on suspicious object lists through the Node Control Manager server consoles.
Configuring Active Directory Connection Settings
Setting a time slot to Idle creates consecutive time periods during which the agent sends heartbeats to the control_manager_prod server.
For example, setting time slots 09 and 13 to Idle creates two periods of consecutive time slots.
You can specify up to three consecutive time periods of Scheduled time slots during which the agent sends a heartbeat to the control_manager_prod server.
If you select Daily or Weekly, specify the time of the update and the time period the Trend Micro Security (for Mac) server will notify agents to update components.
For example, if the start time is 12pm and the time period is 2 hours, the server randomly notifies all online agents to update components from 12pm until 2pm.
If you selected the root icon (), choose from the following options:
Select Agents download updates from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server when unable to connect to the Trend Micro Security (for Mac) server to allow agents to download updates from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server.
If an agent only has an IPv6 address, read the IPv6 limitations for agent updates in .
Select Agents can update the components but not upgrade the agent program or install hot fixes to allow component updates to proceed but prevents Trend Micro Security (for Mac) agent upgrade.

Web Reputation settings include policies that dictate whether Trend Micro Security (for Mac) will block or allow access to a website.
To determine the appropriate policy to use, Trend Micro Security (for Mac) checks the agent's location.
An agent's location is "internal" if it can connect to the Trend Micro Security (for Mac) server.
The security levels determine whether Trend Micro Security (for Mac) will allow or block access to a URL.
For example, if you set the security level to Low, Trend Micro Security (for Mac) only blocks URLs that are known to be web threats.
To submit web reputation feedback, click the URL provided.
If you enable this option, agents refer to the same smart protection source list used by OfficeScan agents to determine the Smart Protection Servers to which they send queries.
Endpoints must have Internet connection to send queries successfully.
Allow agents to send logs if you want to analyze URLs being blocked by Trend Micro Security (for Mac) and take the appropriate action on URLs you think are safe to access.
If an agent only has an IPv6 address, read the IPv6 limitations for Web Reputation queries in .

Conref - Virtual Analyzer
Medium: IP address/domain/URL is unknown to reputation service
Suspicious object type: IP address, domain, URL, or SHA-1
Action configured by control_manager_prod administrators against the suspicious object
control_manager_prod automatically deploys the actions to certain managed products.
Supported objects include files (SHA-1 hash values), IP addresses, domains, and URLs.
Managed products with Virtual Analyzer send a list of suspicious objects to control_manager_prod.
control_manager_prod displays suspicious objects in AdministrationSuspicious ObjectsVirtual Analyzer Objects, in the Objects tab.
From the list of Virtual Analyzer suspicious objects (AdministrationSuspicious ObjectsVirtual Analyzer Objects), control_manager_prod administrators can select objects that are considered safe and then add them to an exception list.
control_manager_prod sends the exception list back to the managed products with Virtual Analyzer.
If a suspicious object from a managed product matches an object in the exception list, the product no longer sends it to control_manager_prod.
control_manager_prod administrators can add objects they consider suspicious but are not currently in the list of Virtual Analyzer suspicious objects by going to AdministrationSuspicious ObjectsUser-Defined Objects.
control_manager_prod also checks Web Reputation, URL filtering, network content inspection, and rule-based detection logs received from all managed products and then compares them with its list of suspicious objects.
Impact assessment on suspicious objects requires a Trend Micro product called Endpoint Sensor.
control_manager_prod consolidates Virtual Analyzer and user-defined suspicious objects (excluding exceptions) and sends them to certain managed products.
SHA-1 value of the sample where the object was last found
Clicking the SHA-1 value opens the Submissions screen, with the SHA-1 value as the search criteria.
In the pop-up window, click the SHA-1 value to open the Submissions screen with the SHA-1 value as the search criteria.
Managed products that integrate with a Virtual Analyzer submit suspicious files or URLs to Virtual Analyzer for analysis.
Virtual Analyzer then sends the list to its registered control_manager_prod server for consolidation and synchronization purposes.
On the control_manager_prod console, go to the AdministrationSuspicious ObjectsVirtual Analyzer ObjectsObjects tab to view the Virtual Analyzer Suspicious Objects list.
From the list of Virtual Analyzer suspicious objects, control_manager_prod administrators can select objects that are considered safe and then add them to an exception list.
control_manager_prod sends the exception list to the Virtual Analyzers that subscribe to the list.
control_manager_prod checks Web Reputation, URL filtering, network content inspection, and rule-based detection logs received from all managed products and then compares these logs with its list of suspicious objects.
If control_manager_prod locates a match, and the managed product did not stop the suspicious object (for example, block, quarantine, or delete), the detection information displays in the list.
control_manager_prod consolidates Virtual Analyzer and user-defined suspicious object lists (excluding exceptions) and synchronizes the lists with integrated managed products.
control_manager_prod can also send suspicious IP addresses and domains to a third-party product called HP TippingPoint.

This section describes data views that control_manager_prod supports for customizing report templates and log queries.
This section provides recommendations for administrators when installing control_manager_prod and its SQL server on the same computer.
Use a computer with more than 4GB of memory
The minimum memory requirement to install control_manager_prod is 4GB, and the recommended requirement is 8GB.
For a computer with less than 4GB of memory, company_name does not recommend installing control_manager_prod and its SQL server on the same computer.
Configure the maximum amount of memory used by the SQL server
Leave at least 4GB of memory for control_manager_prod and system usage.
For example, if a computer has 8GB of memory, set the maximum memory usage of the SQL server to 4GB.
In this case, 4GB of memory is available for control_manager_prod and system usage.
See for details on how to configure memory usage for the SQL server.
For control_manager_prod managing more than 1,000 products (including OfficeScan agents and ServerProtect Normal servers), company_name recommends using a dedicated SQL server.
If control_manager_prod and the SQL server are installed on different computers, set the same time zone on both computers.
company_name highly recommends using Microsoft SQL Server Standard or Enterprise Edition.
SQL Express is suitable for testing purposes but not for production environments.

Updating a control_manager_prod network is a two-step process:
control_manager_prod can download components either directly from the Trend Micro update server, or from an alternative location.
control_manager_prod deploys update components to managed products, including:
OfficeScan Plug-in Manager Plug-in Programs
Furthermore, check that the network connection between your control_manager_prod server and managed products can accommodate the updates.
The connection is a factor to consider when deciding how many control_manager_prod servers your network needs.
A deployment plan allows you to specify the scope and schedule in which the control_manager_prod server deploys updated components to managed products.
After the control_manager_prod server downloads a new component version from an update source, you can configure control_manager_prod to deploy updated components to managed products immediately, at a specified time, or after a delay period.
For granular component update management, you can configure control_manager_prod to deploy updated components to selected managed products based on different deployment schedules.
control_manager_prod bases the deployment plan delays on the completion time of the download, and these delays are independent of each other.
For example, if you have three folders to update at 5-minute intervals, you can assign the first folder a delay of 5 minutes, and then set delays of 10 and 15 minutes for the two remaining folders, respectively.
If you do not specify a deployment schedule in the deployment plan, control_manager_prod downloads the updates but does not deploy updated components to managed products.
You can configure when managed products can communicate with the control_manager_prod server and download components.
Designating control_manager_prod Servers
Based on the number of managed products and endpoints, decide and designate your control_manager_prod server.
Locate your Windows servers, and then select the ones to assign as control_manager_prod servers.
When selecting a server that will host control_manager_prod, consider the following:
The CPU load
If you are installing control_manager_prod on a server that has other uses (for example, application server), company_name recommends installing on a server that does not run mission-critical or resource-intensive applications.

Select a device and click the icon or right-click a device to perform the following actions:
Deleting any Control Manager device from the Enterprise also removes the device from all policy groups.
The deleted Control Manager device continues functioning as long as connectivity and password policies are current on the device.
The agent will be unable to synchronize its policy with PolicyServer.
Before deleting a Full Disk Encryption device, decrypt your disk, and uninstall the Full Disk Encryption agent.
If you delete a Full Disk Encryption device without deleting the agent, the Full Disk Encryption preboot may be unable to authenticate with PolicyServer and the data may become inaccessible.
Generating a software token creates a unique string that you can use to unlock Control Manager devices and to remotely help Control Manager users reset forgotten passwords.
The software token is only available in the full version of Full Disk Encryption, not Encryption Management for Apple FileVault or Encryption Management for Microsoft BitLocker.
The recovery key is only available to Encryption Management for Apple FileVault and Encryption Management for Microsoft BitLocker agents because they do not use the other recovery methods available in Full Disk Encryption.
Initiating a kill command deletes all Control Manager device data.
The deleted data is different depending on the scope of data that the associated Control Manager agent manages.
For example, initiating a kill command to a Full Disk Encryption device deletes all data from the endpoint, while initiating a kill command to a File Encryption device deletes all files and folders in local or removable storage protected by the File Encryption agent.
The kill command is issued when the Control Manager agent communicates with PolicyServer.
Initiating a lock command to the Control Manager device prevents Control Manager user access until after performing a successful Remote Help authentication.
The lock command is issued when the Control Manager agent communicates with PolicyServer.
Initiating a soft reset command reboots the endpoint.
The command issues the next time that the agent communicates with PolicyServer.

For example, have two control_manager_prod servers that manage the production and testing groups.
Use geographical location as a grouping criterion if the location of the managed products, endpoints, and servers affects the communication between the control_manager_prod server and its managed products, endpoints, or servers.
Control Manager manages policies by user groups.
Groups management differs between PolicyServer MMC and Control Manager.
After modifying policies and groups, PolicyServer synchronizes groups across both consoles.
Control Manager always takes precedence over PolicyServer MMC for policy and group assignment.
Any modifications to the group assignment in PolicyServer MMC are automatically overwritten the next time that Control Manager synchronizes with PolicyServer.
Control Manager automatically creates a group each time a policy with specific targets is deployed.
After deployment, modify the groups a user is in from the Endpoint Encryption Users widget, and modify the users in the policy from the Policy Management screen.
PolicyServer MMC
Add and modify groups directly from the left pane of PolicyServer MMC.
Groups in PolicyServer MMC can be assigned as follows:
Adding Control Manager users to a subgroup does not automatically add the users to the Top Group.
To configure the users within a policy group on Control Manager , use the Endpoint Encryption Users widget.
To configure users within a policy group on PolicyServer MMC, see the Endpoint Encryption PolicyServer MMC Guide.

An example of a user-defined list is the Deny List in Deep Discovery Inspector.
HTTPS scanning on these browsers is not supported on Windows XP, Server 2003/2003 R2, or Server 2008 platforms.
Deployment is the process of strategically distributing control_manager_prod servers in your network environment to facilitate and provide optimal management of antivirus and content security products.
Deploying enterprise-wide, client-server software like control_manager_prod to a network requires careful planning and assessment.
For ease of planning, company_name recommends two deployment architectures:
Single-site deployment: Refers to distributing and managing servers, managed products, and endpoints from a single control_manager_prod located in a central office.
Multiple-site deployment: Refers to distributing and managing control_manager_prod servers in an organization that has main offices in different geographical locations.

InterScan Messaging Security Virtual Appliance Integration
IMSVA Integration
IMSVA Rules
InterScan Messaging Security Virtual Appliance (IMSVA) evaluates data in an email message against a set of defined rules.
Rules determine data that must be protected from unauthorized transmission and the action that IMSVA performs when it detects transmission.
IMSVA rules have the following components:
Mail Route: A set of sender and recipient email addresses or groups, or an LDAP user or group to which the policy is applied.
You can use the asterisk (*) to create wildcard expressions and simplify route configuration.
In TMCM, you can set rules for protecting against data loss using templates.
Action: The action that IMSVA performs if the filter conditions are met.

Logs (1)
This chapter describes how to access control_manager_prod generated logs and logs from managed products registered to control_manager_prod.
Managed products send logs to control_manager_prod at different intervals, depending on their individual log settings.
Managed domains policy enables you to configure the email and/or web domains that your organization manages.
Managed Safari Web Domains: You can specify that files downloaded from specific domains using Safari may only be opened with managed apps.
For example, a PDF downloaded from internal.example.com may be opened with Adobe Reader (a managed app) but not Dropbox (an unmanaged app).
This provides improved containerization of Safari and wider the use as an enterprise browser.
You must disable the following iOS features in the Feature Lock Policy.
Otherwise, the managed Safari Web domains settings will not have any effect, since the downloaded files can be opened with other (unmanaged) apps:
Open documents from managed apps in other apps (7.0 or above)
Open documents from other apps in managed apps (7.0 or above)
Allows the user account to use the Configure button on the Product Directory screen to configure managed product settings or log on to the managed product web console from control_manager_prod
To use control_manager_prod product_version, managed products (for example, OfficeScan, ScanMail for Microsoft Exchange) and other services, you need to obtain Activation Codes and activate the software or services.
Use that key to register your software online on the Trend Micro Customer Licensing Portal website and obtain an Activation Code.
When managed products register to control_manager_prod, the managed products add their Activation Codes to the managed product Activation Code list on the License Management screen.
By default, managed product agents send heartbeat messages every 60 minutes.
Administrators can adjust this value from 5 to 480 minutes (8 hours).
Long-Interval Heartbeats (above 60 minutes): The longer the interval between heartbeats, the greater the number of events that may occur before the control_manager_prod console displays the interval.
Short-Interval Heartbeats (below 60 minutes): Short intervals between heartbeats present a more up-to-date picture of your network status at the control_manager_prod server.
Before adjusting the interval to a number below 15 minutes, study your existing network traffic to understand the impact of increased use of network bandwidth.
control_manager_prod uses Management Communication Protocol (MCP) agents installed on managed servers to communicate with managed products that do not register to the control_manager_prod server through the control_manager_prod management console.
An MCP agent communicates with the control_manager_prod server by sending a heartbeat at a regular interval to indicate that the managed product is operating normally.
Administrators can configure the Agent Communication Schedule to determine when agents send heartbeats to the control_manager_prod server.
control_manager_prod only allows you to configure the Agent Communication Schedule for managed products that register to the control_manager_prod server through the control_manager_prod management console.
The Product Directory uses the following icons to represent managed products that are registered to the control_manager_prod server.

Control Manager is limited to remotely controlling monitoring rules in Endpoint Sensor servers where the rules are part of a Endpoint Sensor policy.
If a new Endpoint Sensor server is registered via AdministrationManaged Servers, Control Manager automatically includes the new Endpoint Sensor server in its rule deployment schedule.
Once the next deployment schedule is due, Control Manager uploads all active monitoring rules to the newly registered server.
Click Upload IOC RuleChoose File, and navigate to the location of the monitoring rule.
It is recommended to specify the target Endpoint Sensor servers before uploading the rule.
The Upload IOC Rule feature is enabled only when there is at least one Endpoint Sensor server registered to Control Manager.
Uploading the same monitoring rule in both Control Manager and in a Endpoint Sensor server registered with Control Manager may cause conflicts.
The file already exists in the Endpoint Sensor server.
Use the Endpoint Sensor management console to remove the file first, and try again."
Afterwards, update the remote rule of the Endpoint Sensor servers specified as targets in this policy.
Removal of a monitoring rule also removes the monitoring rule from all other Endpoint Sensor policies.
Use the Submission Settings tab to specify if the collected files are sent to a local file server, or sent to Deep Discovery Analyzer for further analysis.
Control Manager is unable to configure a proxy connection between Endpoint Sensor endpoints and Deep Discovery Analyzer.
To configure a proxy connection between Endpoint Sensor endpoints and Deep Discovery Analyzer, use the Proxy screen of the Endpoint Sensor server computer.

Perform the following steps to properly utilize the control_manager_prod Automation APIs:
Obtain an Application ID and API key by adding the integrated product solution to the control_manager_prod console.
Create a JSON Web Token (JWT) using the Application ID and API key and send an authorization request to the intended Automation API.
Do not transmit the API key as part of the request.
Verify whether control_manager_prod accepted the API request.
Using Control Manager Automation APIs
company_name_tm_control_manager_prod_tm provides access to some internal product functionalities through control_manager_prod Automation APIs allowing users to integrate third-party solutions.
Using the APIs may potentially expose sensitive information, such as agent and endpoint information, which could result in state-changing effects such as agent isolation.
To ensure that only trusted applications can use the APIs, generate an authentication JSON Web Token (JWT) that the trusted applications send with API requests.
control_manager_prod verifies the validity of all API requests from third-party applications using the JWT information.
For a list of available APIs and supported functions, see .
Create a JSON Web Token (JWT) using the Application ID and API key and send the JWT in the authorization header of the request to the intended Automation API.

control_manager_prod allows you to search the Product Directory for managed product entity names, domains, and endpoints using partial string matching.
The available criteria, operators, and values change depending on the products registered to control_manager_prod and the previous filtering selections.
control_manager_prod supports up to 20 filtering criteria for searches.
company_name recommends a phased upgrade for large, single-server control_manager_prod 6.0 networks.
Install control_manager_prod product_version on a server that does not have any previous control_manager_prod version installed (preferably without any managed products).
Run the AgentMigrateTool.exe tool on the control_manager_prod product_version server.
Use the control_manager_prod agent installation together with the Agent Migration tool to plan the upgrade of agents on existing control_manager_prod networks.
The Agent Migration tool can generate a list of servers with control_manager_prod agents.
Planning control_manager_prod Agent Migration
There are two ways to migrate agents to a control_manager_prod product_version server:
control_manager_prod generates network traffic when the server and managed products/endpoints communicate.
Plan the control_manager_prod network traffic to minimize the impact on an organization's network.
These are the sources of control_manager_prod-related network traffic:
Managed product registration to control_manager_prod server
control_manager_prod servers, by default, contain all the product profiles available during the control_manager_prod release.
However, if you register a new version of a product to control_manager_prod, a version that does not correspond to any existing product profiles, the new product will upload its profile to the control_manager_prod server.
For brand-new company_name products that have not had a product profile, company_name delivers updates to enable control_manager_prod to identify these products.
When deploying control_manager_prod across a WAN, the control_manager_prod server in the main office administers managed products, endpoints, and other servers in remote offices.
Managed products, endpoints, or servers in remote offices may require different network bandwidth when communicating with the control_manager_prod server over a WAN.
control_manager_prod prioritizes communication with the managed products, endpoints, or servers with the faster connections.
Use the recommended system requirements as a guide in determining the CPU and RAM requirements for your control_manager_prod network.
The most critical factor in determining how many managed products and endpoints a single control_manager_prod server can manage on a local network is the agent-server communication.
Policies in Control Manager
When a new endpoint registers to Control Manager , it goes through the filtered policies in the list in descending order.
Control Manager assigns the new endpoint to a filtered policy when the following conditions are both satisfied:
This column is not used in Control Manager .
Filtered: This option is not used in Control Manager.
Displays the number of managed products or endpoints to which Control Manager has not assigned a policy.
The Endpoint Application Control system tray icon () can display notifications, allow the user to request access to applications, and allow the user to manually update Endpoint Application Control settings and logs.
Select Yes to display the icon in matched users' Windows system trays.
For example, users of special-purpose endpoints such as ATMs, medical devices, kiosks, and gas pumps may be confused by notifications and related requests for interaction.
Select Yes to display Endpoint Application Control notifications to matched users.
After Endpoint Application Control blocks or delays an application start using the kernel-level method, Windows may display the following notification to end-users:
Windows Block Notification
Endpoint Application Control is unable to hide this notification.
Endpoint Application Control periodically collects application inventories from endpoints.
The default setting is 15 minutes.
At each policy deployment interval, Endpoint Application Control includes any newly added applications on the endpoint that match rules in the deployed policy.
control_manager_prod generates network traffic when deploying policy settings to managed products and endpoints.
control_manager_prod enforces the policy settings on managed products and endpoints every 24 hours.
A policy contains the Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) information for each endpoint and the setting information.
A policy containing 50,000 targets and a full set of settings can generate up to 1.8MB of network traffic.
The default paths are %SYSTEMROOT% and %WINDIR%.
The default setting is 2 hours.

Understanding Data Loss Prevention
The following table explains how to understand Control Manager user policy membership.
Shows the order that Control Manager applies policies.
When a policy is triggered that affects a user, Control Manager takes the action, and then no other policies affect the user for that event.
Shows whether the user can install new Control Manager devices.
Control Manager policies have the following attributes:
Control Manager Policy Options
To include a managed product or endpoint as the target, make sure the product version of the managed product or endpoint supports policy management in Control Manager .
Once Control Manager deploys a policy to the targets, the settings defined in the policy overwrite the existing settings in the targets.
Control Manager enforces the policy settings in the targets every 24 hours.
Although local administrators can make changes to the settings from the managed product console, the changes are overwritten every time Control Manager enforces the policy settings.
Make sure to use the Product Directory to move the managed PolicyServer instance from the New Entity folder to the Control Manager folder in the Product Directory.
Always allow all applications in the Windows directory (overrides block and lockdown rules)
By default, Endpoint Application Control allows all applications located in the Windows directory.
This functions like an Allow rule for the Windows default path, overriding any Block or Lockdown rules.
Enable protection against suspicious objects (requires subscription to Control Manager)
Endpoint Application Control protects matched endpoints against suspicious objects.
Your network may include more than one Endpoint Application Control server or a server may have moved to a new IP address.
Select Default to use the same server as the one hosting the web console.
Use HTTPS
By default, Endpoint Application Control uses the HTTP or HTTPS configuration selected during server installation.
Select Use HTTPS to permanently set all matched users or endpoints to use HTTPS.
Using this option requires you to import the server CA to agent endpoints.

control_manager_prod provides different ways to protect against suspicious objects not yet identified within your network.
Use the User-Defined Suspicious Objects list or import Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) to take proactive actions on suspicious threats identified by external sources.
The User-Defined Suspicious Objects list allows you to define suspicious file, IP address, URL, and domain objects that your registered Virtual Analyzer has not yet detected on your network.
Import IOC files to perform an in-depth historical analysis on endpoints on your network to determine if a threat has already affected your environment.
Performing an impact assessment on IOCs requires detailed log information regarding the behavior of the endpoint over time.
Only endpoints with Endpoint Sensor 1.5 (or later) installed collect the necessary log information required to perform this type of detailed analysis.
Through integration with OfficeScan 11.0 SP1 (or later) agents, you can isolate affected endpoints to prevent the further spread of the threats identified on endpoints.

If you choose "Clean" as the first action, select a second action that Trend Micro Security (for Mac) performs if cleaning is unsuccessful.
When Trend Micro Security (for Mac) detects a security risk during Real-time Scan, it can display a notification message to inform the user about the detection.
Automatically stop Scheduled Scan when scanning lasts more than __ hours and __ minutes
Specify the action Trend Micro Security (for Mac) performs when a particular scan type detects a security risk.
The action Trend Micro Security (for Mac) performs depends on the scan type that detected the security risk.
For example, when Trend Micro Security (for Mac) detects a security risk during Manual Scan (scan type), it cleans (action) the infected file.
The following are the actions Trend Micro Security (for Mac) can perform against security risks:
Trend Micro Security (for Mac) removes the infected file from the endpoint.
Trend Micro Security (for Mac) renames and then moves the infected file to the quarantine directory on the endpoint located in /common/lib/vsapi/quarantine.
Once in the quarantine directory, Trend Micro Security (for Mac) can perform another action on the quarantined file, depending on the action specified by the user.
Trend Micro Security (for Mac) can delete, clean, or restore the file.
Trend Micro Security (for Mac) removes the security risk from an infected file before allowing users to access it.
If the file is uncleanable, Trend Micro Security (for Mac) performs a second action, which can be one of the following actions: Quarantine, Delete, and Pass.
Trend Micro Security (for Mac) performs no action on the infected file but records the detected security risk in the logs.
Trend Micro Security (for Mac) always performs "Pass" on files infected with the Probable Virus/Malware type to mitigate a False Positive.
If further analysis confirms that probable virus/malware is indeed a security risk, a new pattern will be released to allow Trend Micro Security (for Mac) to perform the appropriate scan action.
For example: Trend Micro Security (for Mac) detects "x_probable_virus" on a file named "123.pdf" and performs no action at the time of detection.
Trend Micro then confirms that "x_probable_virus" is a Trojan horse program and releases a new Virus Pattern version.
After loading the new pattern, Trend Micro Security (for Mac) will detect "x_probable_virus" as a Trojan program and, if the action against such programs is "Delete", will delete "123.pdf".
When a particular scan type runs, Trend Micro Security (for Mac) checks the scan exclusion list to determine which files on the endpoint will be excluded from scanning.
Trend Micro Security (for Mac) will not scan a file if:
Trend Micro Security (for Mac) will not scan a file if its file extension matches any of the extensions included in this exclusion list.
Trend Micro Security (for Mac) agents can use one of two scan methods when scanning for security risks.
A conventional scan agent stores all Trend Micro Security (for Mac) components on the agent endpoint and scans all files locally.

Suspicious Object Hub and Node Control Manager Architecture
trend_client_program_plural can also monitor connections that may be the result of a botnet or other malware threat.
After detecting a malware threat, trend_client_program_plural can attempt to clean the infection.
You must enable network connection logging before trend_client_program_plural can allow access to addresses in the User-defined Blocked IP list.
You must enable Log connections using malware network fingerprinting before trend_client_program_plural can attempt to clean the connections made to C&C servers detected by packet structure matching.
You can view suspicious object detections in your environment in many ways using the control_manager_prod console.
control_manager_prod only identifies users or endpoints exposed to suspicious objects in your environment.
You cannot take any direct action on any suspicious objects using the control_manager_prod console.
This section presents material administrators need to synchronize suspicious object lists across multiple product_short_name servers.
Trend Micro Control Manager Suspicious Object Hub and Node architecture allows you to synchronize suspicious object lists across multiple Control Manager servers.
The suspicious object lists on the Hub Control Manager server consolidate the suspicious object lists from all Node Control Manager servers, and any other managed products registered to any of these servers, and then deploys the lists back to the Node Control Manager servers.
Administrators must first configure a Suspicious Object Hub Control Manager server and, depending on the environment, assign other Control Manager servers to act as Suspicious Object Node servers.
Trend Micro Deep Discovery products can register to the Suspicious Object Hub or any Suspicious Object Node Control Manager server.
This architecture requires that you configure all suspicious object actions through the Suspicious Object Hub Control Manager server console.
You must perform all operations on the suspicious object lists through the Suspicious Object Hub Control Manager to ensure that all Node Control Manager servers remain properly synchronized.
Scan actions performed on suspicious objects though a Suspicious Object Node Control Manager may not synchronize to all connected servers.
This section discusses how to use the product_name Suspicious Object List Exporter (SuspiciousObjectExporter.exe) and Importer (ImportSOFromCSV.exe) tools.
The Trend Micro control_manager_trademarked Suspicious Object List Exporter and Importer tools allow you to export and import control_manager_prod Suspicious Object lists without having to sign in to the control_manager_prod management console.
Suspicious Object List Exporter: Exports Suspicious Object lists from the control_manager_prod server in multiple file formats.
Suspicious Object List Importer: Imports properly formatted comma-separated value (CSV) suspicious object data into control_manager_prod.
Use the Exporter and Importer tools to synchronize suspicious object data across multiple control_manager_prod servers and supported third-party applications to enhance your protection against unknown and emerging threats.
control_manager_prod allows you to synchronize Suspicious Object lists among managed products and create User-Defined and Exception lists to further control the spread of suspicious objects.
For more information about products that can synchronize Suspicious Objects lists with control_manager_prod, see Suspicious Object list synchronization in .
control_manager_prod consolidates Virtual Analyzer Suspicious Objects lists and synchronizes all Suspicious Object lists among many managed products.
Administrators can configure specific scan actions on Suspicious Objects using the control_manager_prod console.
On the control_manager_prod console, go to the AdministrationSuspicious ObjectsVirtual Analyzer ObjectsExceptions tab to view the Virtual Analyzer Suspicious Object Exceptions.
The Trend Micro Suspicious Object Migration Tool allows you to migrate suspicious object data from a control_manager_prod server to third-party applications without having to manually export, format, and import individual control_manager_prod Suspicious Object lists.
This user guide explains how to use the Suspicious Object Migration Tool with the Trend Micro Suspicious Object List Exporter and Check Point Suspicious Activity Monitoring (SAM) Client tools.
Suspicious Object Migration Tool: Executes the Suspicious Object List Exporter tool and the Check Point SAM Client in a loop.
Check Point SAM Client: Properly formats and imports suspicious object data to a Check Point server.
To manually migrate individual control_manager_prod Suspicious Object lists to a Check Point server, you can also use the Suspicious Object List Exporter and Check Point SAM Client tools without executing the Suspicious Object Migration Tool.
This section presents material administrators need to use the product_short_name Suspicious Object Migration Tool.
Using the control_manager_prod console, administrators can configure scan actions that certain managed products take after detecting specific suspicious objects in the Virtual Analyzer Suspicious Objects list or the User-Defined Suspicious Objects list.
OfficeScan XG SP1 (or later)
IP address: Log, Block
IP address: No scan actions performed
File SHA-1: Log, Block, Quarantine
InterScan Web Security Virtual Appliance 6.5 Patch 2 (or later)
Trend Micro Endpoint Application Control 2.0 SP1 Patch 1 (or later)
OfficeScan 11.0 SP1 (or later) integrated Smart Protection Server
Smart Protection Server classifies all URLs in the User-Defined Suspicious Objects list as High risk.
Only certain managed products can directly perform the actions configured in control_manager_prod on suspicious URL objects.
Other managed products take action on suspicious URL objects based on the product's configured Web Reputation settings.
control_manager_prod interprets logs sent from the managed product and displays the suspicious object detection on the control_manager_prod console.
Displays the IP addresses of computers affected by suspicious threats.
Example: A managed product detects 10 policy violation instances of the same policy on 2 computers.
Unique Policies/Rules = 1
Displays the IP addresses of sources where suspicious threats originate.

Endpoint Sensor does not support Suspicious Object list synchronization.
The Trend Micro Management Communication Protocol (MCP) is the control_manager_prod communications backbone.
MCP implements the following policies:
MCP Heartbeat: The MCP heartbeats to control_manager_prod ensure that control_manager_prod displays the latest information and that the connection between the managed product and the control_manager_prod server is functional.
MCP Command Polling: When an MCP agent initiates a command poll to control_manager_prod, control_manager_prod notifies the agent to send managed product logs or issues a command to the managed product.
control_manager_prod also interprets a command poll as a passive heartbeat verifying the connection between control_manager_prod and the managed product.

Troubleshooting Active Directory Synchronization
Active Directory synchronization allows control_manager_prod to obtain user information (such as site and reporting line information) from Active Directory servers.
If an Active Directory related error appears on the Dashboard screen, refer to the following table for troubleshooting solutions.
Verify that the user account has privileges to access the Active Directory server.
For assistance, contact the Active Directory administrator.
Unable to connect to the Active Directory server
Ensure that you have configured the correct Active Server connection settings.
Check that the Active Directory server is available.
Ensure that both the control_manager_prod and Active Directory servers can establish communication with one another.
To test your control_manager_prod connection to Active Directory servers, click Test Connection on the Active Directory and Compliance Settings screen.
Unable to access the Control Manager database
Ensure that the connection to the control_manager_prod database is present.
Early in the control_manager_prod deployment, determine exactly how many people you want to grant access to your control_manager_prod server.
Centralized management: This model gives control_manager_prod access to as few people as possible.
A main control_manager_prod administrator would still be necessary, but he or she shares the responsibility for overseeing the network with other product or regional administrators.
Grant control_manager_prod access to each administrator, but limit access rights to view and/or configure segments of the control_manager_prod network that are under their responsibility.
With one of these administration models initialized, you can then configure the Product Directory and necessary user accounts to manage your control_manager_prod network.
Understanding control_manager_prod Network Traffic
Understanding control_manager_prod Server Distribution
control_manager_prod can manage products regardless of physical location, and so it is possible to manage all your antivirus and content security products using a single control_manager_prod server.
However, there are advantages to dividing control of your control_manager_prod network among different servers.
Based on the uniqueness of your network, you can decide the optimum number of control_manager_prod servers.
control_manager_prod provides the following Data Loss Prevention (DLP) user roles:
You can only assign the DLP Compliance Officer and DLP Incident Reviewer roles to Active Directory user accounts.
The following table describes the features and characteristics related to the DLP user roles:
DLP logs
View DLP log data for all Active Directory users
Access specific widgets that display DLP incident information
Access limited to DLP logs related to directly managed users
View DLP incident data for all Active Directory users by clicking the settings icon () on any of the following DLP Incident Investigation widgets and selecting All managed users for the Scope.
By default, the scope for each DLP Incident Investigation widget only allows this role to view incident data for Directly managed users.
Changing the Scope for one DLP Incident Investigation widget does not affect the scope of any other widget.
User accounts assigned with the Administrator and DLP Compliance Officer role can view data from all Active Directory users reported by managed products according to the user account's product scope
The DLP Compliance Officer role cannot view any data
View DLP incident data for directly managed users
Access the DLP Incident Investigation tab and the following widgets:
Link to the control_manager_prod web console
The DLP Incident Reviewer role does not receive this notification.
As with single-site deployment, collect relevant network information and identify how this information relates to deploying control_manager_prod to your multiple sites.
Given the uniqueness of each network, exercise judgment as to how many control_manager_prod servers would be optimal.
Deploy control_manager_prod servers in a number of different locations, including the demilitarized zone (DMZ) or the private network.
Position the control_manager_prod server in the DMZ on the public network to administer managed products, endpoints, or other servers and access the control_manager_prod web console using Internet Explorer over the Internet.
A multi-site deployment using multiple control_manager_prod servers
Decide where to install the control_manager_prod server
Single-site deployment refers to distributing and managing servers, managed products, and endpoints from a single control_manager_prod located in a central office.
A single-site deployment using a single control_manager_prod server
Before deploying control_manager_prod to a single site, complete the following tasks:
Designate the control_manager_prod server
control_manager_prod uses the Microsoft SQL Server database (db_ControlManager.mdf) to store data included in logs, Communicator schedule, managed product and child server information, user account, network environment, and notification settings.
The control_manager_prod server establishes the database connection using a System DSN ODBC connection.
The control_manager_prod installation generates this connection as well as the ID and password used to access db_ControlManager.mdf.
The default ID is sa.
control_manager_prod encrypts the password.
To maximize the SQL server security, configure any SQL account used to manage db_ControlManager with the following minimum permissions:
db_owner for the db_ControlManager role
Managed products send various log types to Control Manager.
Web Security logs
Database Size (MB)
An OfficeScan managed product sends 20,000 virus logs and 10,000 web security logs to Control Manager daily.
Control Manager keeps both log types for 90 days.
The database space required is 1.2 GB for virus logs and 1 GB for web security logs.
Because the control_manager_prod database runs on a scalable database — SQL Server, the theoretical limit is whatever the hardware can handle.
company_name has tested up to 2,000,000 entries.
If the database server performance is overworked or pushed to its limit, the web console may experience connection time-outs.
To access all tables in the control_manager_prod database, use a Microsoft Access project (*.adp /*.ade) or Microsoft SQL Management Studio.
Do not use any of the SQL tools to add, delete, or modify records without instructions from Trend Micro Technical Support.
The following tables make up the control_manager_prod database:
Stores Web access violation logs from products
Stores Content violation logs received from ScanMail and InterScan Messaging products
Stores Net packet scanning logs from network-based products such as Deep Discovery Inspector
Stores Data Loss Prevention related logs sent/received from products
* corresponds to Virus, Event, StatusEngineInfo, and StatusPatternInfo
Stores personal firewall detection log from OfficeScan
Stores malicious system behavior incident detected by OfficeScan
Stores blocked C&C server connection attempt logs from OfficeScan
Stores intrusion prevention logs from Deep Security and Vulnerability Protection
Stores Predictive Machine Learning detection logs from OfficeScan
Stores endpoint application control violation logs from Endpoint Application Control
Stores information as to who, which options, and what time a user accesses the web console; this is useful for auditing web console accesses
Stores information for MsgReceiver.exe, CmdProcessor.exe, LogReceiver.exe, LogRetriever.exe, etc.
* corresponds to Virus, Event, Status, PEInfo, WebSecurity.
DLP incident details
control_manager_prod lists policies from the highest to the lowest priority.
When administrators create a filtered policy, control_manager_prod saves the new policy as the lowest priority policy.
control_manager_prod places draft policies at the bottom of the list.
This column only appears if the selected product is OfficeScan Agent.
If settings are consistent between the policy and its parent, 0 (zero) displays.
You can also assign multiple owners by assigning the policy to an Active Directory group.
ProductAgents :: Uninstall
To uninstall product agents, specify the act value as cmd_uninstall_agent in the HTTP request body.
Specify the value as cmd_uninstall_agent.
{ "entity_id":"8a1a84550462-40bc9afc-3770-16ac-cd6c", "act":"cmd_uninstall_agent", "allow_multiple_match":false }

Configure the control_manager_prod server to download components from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server or other update sources.
You can specify other update sources if the control_manager_prod server is unable to connect to the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server directly or if you host an update server in your network.
By default, control_manager_prod uses a more secure HTTPS connection method to download components from the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server or other update sources.
To access other update sources, control_manager_prod supports Remote UNC authentication, which uses a user account from the update source server to share a folder for control_manager_prod to download updates.
Updates - conref
You can also configure control_manager_prod to deploy updated components to managed products based on the deployment plan.
Migrating to control_manager_prod product_version retains previously configured Update Source, Download Schedule, and Deployment Plan configurations for the All Pattern files/Cleanup templates, except Deep Discovery Malware Pattern component on the Scheduled Update screen.
Migrating to control_manager_prod product_version resets the Components configurations on the Manual Update and Scheduled Update screens to default settings.
If you select the Enable intelligent component downloading check box, control_manager_prod automatically selects all components based on the selected component categories.
To minimize control_manager_prod network traffic, disable the downloading of components that have no corresponding managed products or services.
(Optional) Select Enable intelligent component downloading to allow control_manager_prod to automatically detect and download new components based on the selected component categories from an update source.
When you select this option, control_manager_prod also downloads updates for all existing components in the selected categories.
If the intelligent component downloading feature is not enabled, control_manager_prod only downloads updates for existing components selected in the component list during a scheduled or manual update.
Other update source: Type the URL of the update source in the text field.
You can specify up to five update sources by clicking the + icon.
If the control_manager_prod server uses a proxy server to connect to an update source, configure the proxy settings on the Proxy Settings screen.
Immediately: control_manager_prod deploys the updated components to the managed products as soon as control_manager_prod finishes downloading new component versions.
Start at: control_manager_prod deploys updated components to managed products at the specified time.
Delay: control_manager_prod deploys updated components to managed products after waiting for the specified time.
Click + Add to add a new deployment schedule.
If you do not specify a deployment schedule, control_manager_prod downloads the component updates but does not deploy updated components to managed products.
Select this option if you do not want control_manager_prod to automatically deploy updated components to managed products.
To reduce network traffic during peak hours, you can specify the time the managed products can download components from the control_manager_prod server after receiving an update notification.

User Accounts - Basic steps conref
Use the User Accounts screen to create new user accounts for product_name administrators or to import users or groups from an integrated Active Directory structure.
Only the Root, Administrator, or Administrator and DLP Compliance Officer accounts can create new user accounts.
Importing users or groups from an Active Directory structure requires an integrated Active Directory structure.
Integrating an Active Directory structure allows Active Directory users or groups to log on to product_name by using the Log On with Domain Credentials button without having to provide their user names and passwords.
product_name cannot disable accounts for Active Directory users or groups.
To disable an Active Directory account, you must disable the account from the Active Directory server.
To create a new product_name user account:
Type the account name that the user provides to log on to the control_manager_prod web console.
Type the password that the user provides to log on to the control_manager_prod web console.
This field is required for control_manager_prod to send reports and event notifications by email or when Two-Factor Authentication is enabled.
To import users or groups from an integrated Active Directory structure:
Search for Active Directory users or groups using the following:
You can use an asterisk wildcard (*) to search using partial string matching.
For example, typing tom* searches for all users or groups with names that start with tom.
Active Directory accounts that match the specified criteria appear in the Search result list.
Select Active Directory users or groups from the Search result list and click >.
The selected Active Directory users or groups appear in the Selected users/groups list.
product_name product_version requires you to manually synchronize Active Directory data before imported users or groups can log on to product_name using their Active Directory domain credentials.
You do not need to manually synchronize Active Directory data from an Active Directory structure migrated from product_name 6.0.
Users and groups from the migrated Active Directory structure can log on to product_name as soon as the migration completes.
The User Accounts > Step 2: Access Control screen appears.
The DLP Compliance Officer and DLP Incident Reviewer roles are only available to Active Directory users or groups.
You can restrict a user to a single managed product or allow access to the entire Product Directory.
The User Accounts screen provides a list of all previously configured user accounts for the product_name console.
