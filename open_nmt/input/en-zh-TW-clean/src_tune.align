Introducing Trend Micro Worry-Free Business Security Standard and Advanced
This chapter provides an overview of product_name (product_short_name).
The IPv6 requirements for the Security Server are as follows:
The Security Server to be upgraded must be installed on Windows Server 2008, SBS 2008/2011, 7, and Vista.
The Security Server must already be using an IIS web server.
Apache web server does not support IPv6 addressing.
Assign an IPv6 address to the Security Server.
In product_short_name, keywords include the following and are used to filter messages:
Short phrases (blue fish, red phone, big house, and so on)
Words or phrases connected by logical operators (apples .AND. oranges)
product_short_name can import an existing list of keywords from a text (.txt) file.
The Messaging Security Agent searches content that matches the word
The Messaging Security Agent searches for any of the keywords separated by OR
The agent searches for either apple or orange.
The Messaging Security Agent searches for all of the keywords separated by AND
The agent searches for both apple and orange.
The Messaging Security Agent excludes keywords following NOT from search.
For example, .NOT. juice. The agent searches for content that does not contain juice.
The Messaging Security Agent does not support using “?” in the wildcard command “.WILD.”.
The words Valumart, valucash, and valubucks all match.
To specify a regular expression, add a .REG. operator before that pattern (for example, .REG. a.*e).
For example, “.REG. a.*e” matches: “ace”, “ate”, and “advance”, but not “all”, “any”, nor “antivirus”
The Messaging Security Agent offers simple and powerful features to create highly specific filters.
By default, the Messaging Security Agent searches for exact matches of keywords.
You can also set the Messaging Security Agent to search for synonyms of the actual keywords.
“Click here to buy guns bombs and other weapons.”
“Click here to buy guns, bombs, and other weapons.”
“Click here to buy used guns, new bombs, and other weapons.”
“Buy ammunition for your guns and weapons and new bombs”
The installation files will be extracted to the same directory where the .exe file is located.

Manual Scan on Security Agents eliminates threats from files and eradicates old infections, if any, to minimize reinfection.
Run a manual update from the web console if an update is urgent.
Mass-mailing behavior describes a situation when an infection spreads rapidly in a Microsoft Exchange environment.
The agent receives a message containing a worm such as a variant of MyDoom.
Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10, Server 2003, SBS 2003 or Server 2008
Windows Server 2008 R2, Home Server 2011, 2012/2012 R2, 2012/2012 R2 Essentials, 2016
Messaging Security Agents can only be installed if you have the Advanced version of product_name.
Perform a fresh installation of the Messaging Security Agent on Microsoft Exchange servers.
For information on upgrading Messaging Security Agents to this version, see the Installation and Upgrade Guide.
The Messaging Security Agent (Advanced only) must be installed on a dual-stack or pure IPv6 Microsoft Exchange server.
All major editions and 64-bit versions of the listed operating systems are supported unless noted otherwise.
The Messaging Security Agent (MSA) requires the following components:
1GHz x64 processor supporting AMD64 and Intel EM64T technologies
500MB for the Messaging Security Agent program files
The Messaging Security Agent has the following limitations:
Agents support the same virtualization applications supported by the Security Server.
Target Folder: The folder where the Messaging Security Agent files are installed
selected, product_short_name stores spam mail into this folder.
After you click Next, the program begins installing the Messaging Security Agent.
Messaging Security Agents can only be installed on Microsoft Exchange servers.
The Security Groups Tree in the web console displays all the Messaging Security Agents.
product_short_name uses the Messaging Security Agent to gather security information from Microsoft Exchange servers.
For example, the Messaging Security Agent reports spam detections or completion of component updates to the Security Server.
In computers running Microsoft Exchange Server 2007, the Messaging Security Agent uses a SQL Server database.
Whenever this instance is stopped or restarted, the following Messaging Security Agent services are also stopped:
Manually restart these services if MSSQL$SCANMAIL is stopped or restarted.
Different events, including when SQL Server is updated, can cause MSSQL$SCANMAIL to restart or stop.
Remove other endpoint security software currently installed on the client and then replace it with the Security Agent
Mobile security settings prevent unauthorized devices from accessing and downloading information from the Microsoft Exchange Server.
The Security Servers must be of the same language version.
Record the host name and listening port of the Security Server to which an agent will move.
Type cd and the path to the Security Agent installation folder.
The name of the destination product_short_name server (the server to which the agent will transfer)
The listening port (or trusted port) of the destination Security Server.
The port number used by the Security Agent to communicate with the server
On the web console of the Security Server that currently manages the agents, navigate to Security Settings.
To move Security Agents, select a group and then select the agents.
To move a Messaging Security Agent, select it.
Type the host name and listening port of the Security Server to which agents will move.
Use the web console to move one or several agents.
If you have at least two Security Servers, move Security Agents between servers.

If you have at least two Security Servers, move Messaging Security Agents between servers.
Use the web console to move one agent at a time.
On the Security Server computer, navigate to \PCCSRV\Admin\Utility.
product_short_name generates network traffic when the Security Server and agents communicate with each other.
The Security Server generates significant network traffic when it updates a component.
To reduce network traffic generated during component updates, the Security Server performs component duplication.
A Security Server that is updated regularly only downloads the incremental pattern.
product_short_name now supports Security Server installation on endpoints running Windows 10 Pro.
product_short_name now supports Security Server installation on endpoints running Windows Server 2016.
product_short_name can send notifications in the form of email messages to various alerts.
The Messaging Security Agent divides email traffic into two network categories: internal and external.
The agent queries the Microsoft Exchange server to learn how the internal and external addresses are defined.
You can only define one domain as the internal address for the Messaging Security Agent.
For example, you have two domain addresses for your company: @example_1.com and @example2.com.
Later, you use Microsoft Exchange System Manager to change the primary address to @example_2.com.
This means that Microsoft Exchange now recognizes addresses such as abc@example_2.com and xyz@example_2.com to be internal addresses.
A client is a computer where you plan to install a Security Agent or a Messaging Security Agent.
A single Security Server installation can manage up to 2.500 clients.
If you have more clients, Trend Micro suggests installing more than one Security Server.
High-color display with a resolution of 1024x768 or higher
