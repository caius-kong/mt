This app may contain malicious software capable of hijacking and holding your device for ransom. Tap Uninstall to remove this app from your device.
Fake apps trick users into installing them by using real companies or popular references. Once installed, fake apps can perform a number of actions. They can push ads, track and report location and other sensitive information. These can lead to data loss, privacy issues and other wasted resources.
Apps which include threats pose a risk to your safety.
Potentially unwanted applications are installed in devices and may pose a high risk to user security and/or privacy. They usually do not clearly and completely state their functions and purposes, and users may be unaware of the actions of the application.
Ransomware locks you out of your device or prevents you from opening important personal files until you pay the anonymous attacker.
Apps which have vulnerabilities may leave devices open to attack.
Apps which pose a privacy risk may be secretly attempting to steal private information, which can then be sent to a third party without the userâs knowledge or approval.
Vulnerabilities are security weaknesses which may leave devices open to attack.

Many malicious programs create copies of themselves or other malicious programs using file names used by Windows system files. This is typically done to override or replace system files, avoid detection, or discourage users from deleting the malicious files.
Duplicated System File
The Hosts file matches domain names with IP addresses. Many malicious programs modify the Hosts file so that the Web browser is redirected to infected, non-existent, or fake Web sites.
Hosts File Modification
Suspicious behavior can be a specific action or a series of actions that is rarely carried out by legitimate programs. Programs exhibiting suspicious behavior should be used with caution.
New Internet Explorer Plugin
Many viruses and spyware programs change Internet Explorer settings, including the home page, trusted Web sites, proxy server settings, and menu extensions.
Internet Explorer Setting Modification
Security Policy Modification
Many malicious programs configure Windows so that all applications automatically load a program library (DLL). This allows the malicious routines in the DLL to run every time an application starts.
Program Library Injection
Changes to Windows shell settings can also allow malicious programs to track the programs used and start alongside legitimate applications.
Windows services are processes that have special functions and typically run continuously in the background with full administrative access. Malicious programs sometimes install themselves as services to stay hidden.
Certain Windows system files determine system behavior, including startup programs and screensaver settings. Many malicious programs modify system files to launch automatically at startup and control system behavior.
System File Modification
The Windows Firewall policy determines the applications that have access to the network, the ports that are open for communication, and the IP addresses that can communicate with the computer. Many malicious programs modify the policy to allow themselves to access to the network and the Internet.
Firewall Policy Modification
Many malicious programs perform various actions on built-in Windows processes. These actions can include terminating or modifying running processes.
System Process Modification
Malicious applications usually add or modify autostart entries in the Windows registry to automatically launch every time the computer starts.
