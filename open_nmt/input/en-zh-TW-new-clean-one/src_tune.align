Use the more compatible, less feature-rich, user-level blocking method
User-level blocking allows applications to start and then stops them at the task level.
This may be unable to stop certain applications after they start and is less feature-rich than kernel-level blocking.
User-level blocking is unable to block DLLs and is unable to support the Trusted Source feature.
User-level blocking is only available for endpoint-matching policies.
Kernel-level blocking prevents applications from starting by blocking file access.
This provides greater security, but may unexpectedly block access to certain files needed by allowed applications.
Trend Micro recommends user-level blocking only if you are having problems with kernel-level blocking.
User-level blocking is only available for endpoint-matching policies. User-matching policies always apply kernel-level blocking.

plug_in_prog_parent_program includes a framework called Plug-in Manager that integrates new solutions into the existing plug_in_prog_parent_program environment.
None of the plug-in solutions currently support IPv6.
Some native plug_in_prog_parent_program features are licensed separately and activated through Plug-in Manager.
Plug-in programs are not part of the plug_in_prog_parent_program program.
The plug-in programs have separate licenses and management consoles.
Access the management consoles from within the plug_in_prog_parent_program web console.
Examples of plug-in programs are Trend Micro OfficeScan ToolBox and Trend Micro Security (for Mac).
Refer to specific plug-in program documentation for details on configuring and managing the program.
However, manage policies carefully to avoid creating conflicting firewall policies and producing unexpected results.
See the Microsoft documentation for details on Windows Firewall.
The product_short_name firewall includes the following key features and benefits:
Web threats encompass a broad array of threats that originate from the Internet.
For example, web threat creators constantly change the version or variant used.
One goal is to steal information for subsequent sale.
The resulting impact is leakage of confidential information in the form of identity loss.
The infected computer_device may also become a vector to deliver phish attacks or other information capturing activities.
Activities include sending spam or conducting extortion in the form of distributed denial-of-service attacks or pay-per-click activities.
Users can choose to run Windows 10 in desktop mode or tablet mode.
The desktop mode is similar to the classic Windows Start screen.
New features include a scrolling touch screen interface, tiles, and toast notifications.
Tiles are similar to the desktop icons used in previous Windows releases.
Users click or tap on a tile to launch the application associated with the tile.
Live tiles provide users application-specific information that dynamically updates.
Applications can post information to tiles even when the application is not running

product_short_name documentation is intended for the following users:
product_short_name Administrators: Responsible for product_short_name management, including the product_short_name server and trend_client_program_single installation and management.
These users are expected to have advanced networking and server management knowledge.
End users: Users who have the trend_client_program_single installed on their computer_device_plural.
The computer_device skill level of these individuals ranges from beginner to power user.
product_short_name uses public-key cryptography to authenticate communications that the product_short_name server initiates on client_computer_plural.
With public-key cryptography, the server keeps a private key and deploys a public key to all client_computer_plural.
The client_computer_plural use the public key to verify that incoming communications are server-initiated and valid.
The client_computer_plural respond if the verification is successful.
product_short_name does not authenticate communications that client_computer_plural initiate on the server.
The public and private keys are associated with a Trend Micro certificate.
During installation of the product_short_name server, Setup stores the certificate on the host’s certificate store.
Use the Authentication Certificate Manager tool to manage Trend Micro certificates and keys.
Implementing a single certificate key is a common practice for standard levels of security.
This approach balances the security level of your organization and reduces the overhead associated with maintaining multiple keys.
Implementing multiple certificate keys across product_short_name servers provides a maximum level of security.
This approach increases the maintenance required when certificate keys expire and need to be redistributed across the servers.
Before reinstalling the product_short_name server, ensure that you back up the existing certificate.
For details on backing up, restoring, exporting, and importing certificates, see .
Manually configuring proxy settings may be a complicated task for many end users.

Back up the database from the web console by going to .
See the Administrator’s Guide or the product_short_name Server Help for instructions.
Do not use any other type of backup tool or application.
Stop the OfficeScan Master Service from the Microsoft Management Console.
Manually back up the following files and folders found under \PCCSRV:
ous.ini: Contains the update source table for antivirus component deployment
Private folder: Contains firewall and update source settings
Log folder: Contains system events and the connection verification logs
After Setup finishes, open the Microsoft Management Console (services.msc).
Right-click OfficeScan Master Service and then click Stop.
Copy the backup files to the \PCCSRV folder on the target computer_device.
This overwrites the product_short_name server database and the relevant files and folders.
Backing up and Restoring the product_name Database and Configuration Files
Back up the database from the product_name 10.x or 11.x web console by going to Administration Database Backup.
For detailed instructions, see the Administrator's Guide or Server Help for these product versions.
Back up these files and folders to roll back product_name only if you encounter upgrade issues.
Type the location where you want to save the database.
If the folder does not exist yet, select Create the folder if not already present.
Include the drive and full directory path, such as C:\OfficeScan\DatabaseBackup.
By default, OfficeScan saves the backup in the following directory: \DBBackup
product_short_name creates a subfolder under the backup path.
Ensure that the account has write privileges on the computer.
To back up the database and save the changes you made, click Backup Now.
To save only without backing up the database, click Save.
Solution: If product_short_name successfully cleans the infected file, you do not need to keep the backup copy.
If the computer_device functions normally, you can delete the backup file.

Security Agents use one of two scan methods when running scans:
Security Settings {Messaging Security Agent} Configure Settings Content Filtering
Select Monitor the message content of particular email accounts.
Type the name of your rule in the Rule name field.
Select the message part that you want to filter for undesirable content.
The Messaging Security Agent can filter email messages by:
The Messaging Security Agent only supports filtering of these parts of the email message during real-time scan.
It does not support filtering of header and subject content during manual and scheduled scans.
Add keywords for the target part that you want to filter for undesirable content.
For details on working with keywords, see .
If necessary, select whether or not to make content filter case-sensitive.
Import new keyword files from a .txt file as needed.
Select an action for the Messaging Security Agent to take when it detects undesirable content.

After an agent is installed and reports to the Security Server, the server adds it to a group.
Security Agents installed on server platforms are added to the Servers (default) group.
Security Agents installed on desktop platforms are added to the Desktops (default) group.
You can assign Security Agents to other groups by moving them.
Each Messaging Security Agent (Advanced only) is its own group.
It is not possible to organize several Messaging Security Agents into one group.
To check for duplicate agent records, use the Agent Connection Verification feature in PreferencesGlobal Settings System.
Select the message part that you want to evaluate.
The keyword must be from 1 to 64 alphanumeric characters long.

Specify different passwords for the Security Server web console and the Security Agent.
Security Server Web Console: Required to log on the Web Console
Security Agents: Required to uninstall or unload Security Agents from clients
The password field holds 1 – 24 characters and is case sensitive.
Security Agents update from the Security Server, Update Agents, or the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server.
Messaging Security Agents update only from the Security Server.
For details on the update process, see .
Similarly, a pure IPv4 agent cannot obtain updates directly from a pure IPv6 Security Server/Update Agent.
For details on the components that agents update, see .
In addition to the components, agents also receive updated configuration files when updating from the Security Server.
Agents need the configuration files to apply new settings.
Each time you modify agent settings through the web console, the configuration files change.
Clients include desktops, servers, and Microsoft Exchange servers.
Protects desktops and servers from security threats and intrusions
Protects Microsoft Exchange servers from email-borne security threats
An agent reports to the Security Server from which it was installed.
Agents report events such as threat detection, startup, shutdown, start of a scan, and completion of an update.
product_short_name provides two ways to combat spam—Email Reputation and Content Scanning.
The Messaging Security Agent uses the following components to filter email messages for spam and phishing incidents:
Trend Micro updates both the engine and pattern file frequently and makes them available for download.
The Security Server can download these components through a manual or scheduled update.
The anti-spam engine uses spam signatures and heuristic rules to filter email messages.
The Messaging Security Agent compares the spam score to the user-defined spam detection level.
When the spam score exceeds the detection level, the agent takes action against the spam.
An Approved Senders list is a list of trusted email addresses.
A Blocked Senders list is a list of suspect email addresses.
The agent always categorizes email messages from blocked senders as spam and takes the appropriate action.
There are two Approved Senders lists: one for the Microsoft Exchange Administrator and one for the end-users.
The end-user manages the Spam Folder that is created for them during installation.
The end-users’ lists only affect the messages bound for the server-side mailbox store for each individual end-user.
The Messaging Security Agent supports wildcard matching for Approved and Blocked Senders lists.
It uses the asterisk (*) as the wildcard character.
The Messaging Security Agent does not support the wildcard match on the user name part.
However, if you type a pattern such as “*@trend.com”, the agent still treats it as “@trend.com”.
You can only use a wildcard if it is:
Next to only one period and the first or last character of a string
To the left of an @ sign and the first character in the string
Any missing section at the beginning or end of the string serves the same function as a wildcard
Check with QA to see if this info is correct. Copying from OSCE.
Automatic URL approval and blocking helps you control access to websites and create a safer Internet environment.
Identify approved or blocked URLs in the Global Settings.
It is also possible to create customized URL approval and blocking lists for specific groups.
Attachment blocking prevents attachments in email messages from being delivered to the Microsoft Exchange Information Store.
The extension of an attachment identifies the file type, for example .txt, .exe, or .dll.
Many virus/malware are closely associated with certain types of files.
Similarly, specific attacks are often associated with a specific file name.
Using blocking is an effective way to control virus outbreaks.
Later, when you have more time, you can examine the quarantine folder and take action against infected files.
product_name documentation is intended for the following users:
Security Administrators: Responsible for product_name management, including Security Server and agent installation and management.
End users: Users who have the Security Agent installed on their computers.
The computer skill level of these individuals ranges from beginner to power user.
Security Agents and Messaging Security Agents (Advanced only) automatically perform the following updates:
Immediately after installation, the agents update from the Security Server.
Each time the Security Server completes an update, it automatically pushes the updates to agents.
Each time an Update Agent completes an update, it automatically pushes the updates to the respective Security Agents.
Every 8 hours on In Office Security Agents
Every 2 hours on Out of Office Security Agents
By default, Messaging Security Agents run a scheduled update every 24 hours at 12:00 AM.
The Security Agent features available on a client depend on the client's operating system.
Be aware of unsupported features when installing an agent to a particular operating system.
Microsoft Outlook 2007 (32-bit), 2010 (32- and 64-bit), 2013 (32- and 64-bit)
