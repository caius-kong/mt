Event Monitoring provides a more generic approach to protecting against unauthorized software and malware attacks.
It monitors system areas for certain events, allowing administrators to regulate programs that trigger such events.
The following table provides a list of monitored system events.
The Hosts file matches domain names with IP addresses.
Programs exhibiting suspicious behavior should be used with caution.
Spyware/grayware programs often install unwanted Internet Explorer plugins, including toolbars and Browser Helper Objects.
Modifications in Windows Security Policy can allow unwanted applications to run and change system settings.
This allows the malicious routines in the DLL to run every time an application starts.
Many malicious programs modify Windows shell settings to associate themselves to certain file types.
Malicious programs sometimes install themselves as services to stay hidden.
Certain Windows system files determine system behavior, including startup programs and screen saver settings.
Many malicious programs modify system files to launch automatically at startup and control system behavior.
These actions can include terminating or modifying running processes.
When Event Monitoring detects a monitored system event, it performs the action configured for the event.
The following table lists possible actions that administrators can take on monitored system events.
This is the default action for all monitored system events.
This feature is only available for Windows endpoints.

IntelliScan is a method of identifying files to scan.
The scan time is therefore significantly shorter than when you scan all files.
This covers virus/malware, worms, trojans, backdoors and bots.
Virus writers often attempt to circumvent virus/malware filtering by using different file compression schemes.
IntelliTrap uses the same scan engine as virus scanning.
Agents write bot and other malware detections to the IntelliTrap log.
You can export the contents of the IntelliTrap log for inclusion in reports.
IntelliTrap uses the following components when checking for bots and other malicious programs:
