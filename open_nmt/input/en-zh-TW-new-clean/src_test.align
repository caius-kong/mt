Fake apps trick users into installing them by using real companies or popular references. Once installed, fake apps can perform a number of actions. They can push ads, track and report location and other sensitive information. These can lead to data loss, privacy issues and other wasted resources.
Potentially unwanted applications are installed in devices and may pose a high risk to user security and/or privacy. They usually do not clearly and completely state their functions and purposes, and users may be unaware of the actions of the application.
Ransomware locks you out of your device or prevents you from opening important personal files until you pay the anonymous attacker.
Apps which pose a privacy risk may be secretly attempting to steal private information, which can then be sent to a third party without the user’s knowledge or approval.

Many malicious programs create copies of themselves or other malicious programs using file names used by Windows system files. This is typically done to override or replace system files, avoid detection, or discourage users from deleting the malicious files.
The Hosts file matches domain names with IP addresses. Many malicious programs modify the Hosts file so that the Web browser is redirected to infected, non-existent, or fake Web sites.
New Internet Explorer Plugin
Many viruses and spyware programs change Internet Explorer settings, including the home page, trusted Web sites, proxy server settings, and menu extensions.
Internet Explorer Setting Modification
Many malicious programs configure Windows so that all applications automatically load a program library (DLL). This allows the malicious routines in the DLL to run every time an application starts.
Changes to Windows shell settings can also allow malicious programs to track the programs used and start alongside legitimate applications.
Windows services are processes that have special functions and typically run continuously in the background with full administrative access. Malicious programs sometimes install themselves as services to stay hidden.
Certain Windows system files determine system behavior, including startup programs and screensaver settings. Many malicious programs modify system files to launch automatically at startup and control system behavior.
The Windows Firewall policy determines the applications that have access to the network, the ports that are open for communication, and the IP addresses that can communicate with the computer. Many malicious programs modify the policy to allow themselves to access to the network and the Internet.
Many malicious programs perform various actions on built-in Windows processes. These actions can include terminating or modifying running processes.
Malicious applications usually add or modify autostart entries in the Windows registry to automatically launch every time the computer starts.

A brief description about the widget
Description of widget data
Network Group: Group of monitored networks that allow Deep Discovery Inspector to determine whether attacks originate from within or outside the network.
On the Detections screen under Details, click View to log on to Deep Discovery Inspector using single sign-on and display the Detections Log Query Detail screen. If the log is purged, the console displays a message informing you of the action.
When Display hosts by detection count is selected, all range options are available. Alternatively, if Display hosts by detection time is selected, only Today and 1 week are available.
These settings can only be accessed by clicking the Widget Settings icon. The settings affect the widget's title and the data sources for the widget.
To configure the widget:
When selected, only High Severity hosts are displayed. In addition, set either Today, 1 week, 2 weeks, or 1 month for the Range. The Deep Discovery Inspector Affected Hosts widget sorts data based on the Detections column.
- Detection time: Latest 10/25/50/100
When selected, set either Today or 1 week for the Range, and choose from any of the available Severity. The Deep Discovery Inspector Affected Hosts widget sorts data based on the Latest Detection column.
Product Connection Widget
Use this widget to track which managed products or managed servers are active, inactive, or that have an abnormal connection to Control Manager.
Clicking links in the Products column opens a screen that displays detailed information. Control Manager performs an Ad Hoc Query to provide the detailed information.
Inactive: The product or managed server is disconnected, has stopped running, or is unable to establish connection with the Control Manager server
Abnormal: The product/service is unable to establish a connection to the Control Manager server beyond the configured waiting time
These settings can only be accessed by clicking the Edit icon. The settings affect the widget's title and the data sources for the widget.
The data scope specifies the products which the widget uses to display data. This can have a drastic affect on the usefulness of the information that the widget displays.
Use this widget to display the resource usage and number of queued samples waiting for Virtual Analyzer processing for selected Deep Discovery Inspector appliances.

Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol for assigning dynamic IP addresses to devices in a network.
With dynamic addressing, a device can have a different IP address every time it connects to the network.
In some systems, the device’s IP address can even change while it is still connected.
DHCP also supports a mix of static and dynamic IP addresses.
Basic DNS configuration results in a server that performs default resolution.
A domain name should be sufficient to determine a unique Internet address for any host on the Internet.
A Dynamic IP address is an IP address assigned by a DHCP server.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol using Secure Socket Layer (SSL).
HTTPS is a variant of HTTP used for handling secure transactions.
IntelliScan is a method of identifying files to scan.
For executable files (for example, .exe), the true file type is determined based on the file content.
For non-executable files (for example, .txt), the true file type is determined based on the file header.
Performance optimization: IntelliScan does not affect applications on the client because it uses minimal system resources.
If users regularly exchange real-time compressed executable files, disable IntelliTrap.
IntelliTrap uses the following components: Virus Scan Engine, IntelliTrap Pattern, and IntelliTrap Exception Pattern.
Java is a general-purpose programming language developed by Sun Micro Systems.
Java supports programming for the Internet in the form of platform-independent Java "applets."

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an application protocol for querying and modifying directory services running over TCP/IP.
This allows trusted networks with privately assigned IP addresses to have access to the Internet.
NAT traversal has become an increasingly more significant issue in the current real-world network environment.
To address this issue, MCP uses one-way communication.
One-way communication has the MCP agent initiating the connection to, and polling of commands from, the server.
Each request is a CGI-like command query or log transmission.
To reduce the network impact, the MCP agent keeps connection alive and open as much as possible.

The Ping utility can determine if the computer with the specified IP address is online or not.
PAC files are text files containing JavaScript, a high-level programming language.
The PAC files specify which proxies should be used and under what circumstances.
Windows security patches include a Setup program, while non-Windows patches commonly have a setup script.
Both Windows and non-Windows service packs include a Setup program and setup script.
This security protocol provides data encryption, server authentication, message integrity, and optional client authentication for a TCP/IP connection.
