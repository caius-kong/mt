product_short_name applies global client_computer_single settings to all client_computer_plural or only to client_computer_plural with certain privileges.
This widget shows the connection status of all agents with the product_short_name server.
This widget displays components and programs that protect trend_client_program_plural from security risks.
product_short_name monitors files that users access using cloud storage services.
Data Loss Prevention supports encryption on cloud storage services when Endpoint Encryption is installed on the agent endpoint.
company_name control_manager_trademarked manages company_name products and services at the gateway, mail server, file server and corporate desktop levels.
The control_manager_prod web-based management console provides a single monitoring point for products and services throughout the network.
Use control_manager_prod to manage several product_short_name servers from a single location.
Update the OPSWAT engine to version 2.5.1017 to enable the product to detect the client_computer_single’s scan method.
This feature regulates tasks on trend_client_program_plural residing in a single virtual server.
For more details on these platforms, refer to the VMware View, Citrix XenDesktop, or Microsoft Hyper-V websites.
The product_short_name server compares its current full pattern version with the latest version on the ActiveUpdate server.
This incremental pattern accounts for the difference between versions 171 and 175.
On the server, TMEndpointEdt merges version 171 with incremental pattern 171.175 to generate version 175.
The server has 1 incremental pattern (171.175) and the latest full pattern (version 175).
The server does not need to use version 171 because it already has the incremental pattern 171.175.
The server keeps the last 7 full pattern versions (versions 175, 171, 169, 167, 165, 163, 161).
173.175, 171.175, 169.175, 167.175, 165.175, 163.175, 161.175, 159.175, 157.175, 155.175, 153.175, 151.175, 149.175, 147.175

After an agent is installed and reports to the Security Server, the server adds it to a group.
Security Agents installed on server platforms are added to the Servers (default) group.
Security Agents installed on desktop platforms are added to the Desktops (default) group.
You can assign Security Agents to other groups by moving them.
Each Messaging Security Agent (Advanced only) is its own group.
It is not possible to organize several Messaging Security Agents into one group.
The keyword must be from 1 to 64 alphanumeric characters long.
20??”, then type another example that matches, such as “01-Extreme 2010” and then click Test.

Security Agents: Required to uninstall or unload Security Agents from clients
The password field holds 1 – 24 characters and is case sensitive.
Security Agents update from the Security Server, Update Agents, or the Trend Micro ActiveUpdate server.
Messaging Security Agents update only from the Security Server.
Similarly, a pure IPv4 agent cannot obtain updates directly from a pure IPv6 Security Server/Update Agent.
In addition to the components, agents also receive updated configuration files when updating from the Security Server.
Each time you modify agent settings through the web console, the configuration files change.
Clients include desktops, servers, and Microsoft Exchange servers.
Protects Microsoft Exchange servers from email-borne security threats
An agent reports to the Security Server from which it was installed.
product_short_name provides two ways to combat spam—Email Reputation and Content Scanning.
The Messaging Security Agent uses the following components to filter email messages for spam and phishing incidents:
The Security Server can download these components through a manual or scheduled update.
The Messaging Security Agent compares the spam score to the user-defined spam detection level.
There are two Approved Senders lists: one for the Microsoft Exchange Administrator and one for the end-users.
The Messaging Security Agent supports wildcard matching for Approved and Blocked Senders lists.
It uses the asterisk (*) as the wildcard character.
The Messaging Security Agent does not support the wildcard match on the user name part.
However, if you type a pattern such as “*@trend.com”, the agent still treats it as “@trend.com”.
To the left of an @ sign and the first character in the string
Check with QA to see if this info is correct. Copying from OSCE.
Automatic URL approval and blocking helps you control access to websites and create a safer Internet environment.
Identify approved or blocked URLs in the Global Settings.
It is also possible to create customized URL approval and blocking lists for specific groups.
Attachment blocking prevents attachments in email messages from being delivered to the Microsoft Exchange Information Store.
The extension of an attachment identifies the file type, for example .txt, .exe, or .dll.

Security Administrators: Responsible for product_name management, including Security Server and agent installation and management.
End users: Users who have the Security Agent installed on their computers.
Security Agents and Messaging Security Agents (Advanced only) automatically perform the following updates:
Immediately after installation, the agents update from the Security Server.
Each time the Security Server completes an update, it automatically pushes the updates to agents.
Each time an Update Agent completes an update, it automatically pushes the updates to the respective Security Agents.
Every 8 hours on In Office Security Agents
Every 2 hours on Out of Office Security Agents
By default, Messaging Security Agents run a scheduled update every 24 hours at 12:00 AM.
The Security Agent features available on a client depend on the client's operating system.
Microsoft Outlook 2007 (32-bit), 2010 (32- and 64-bit), 2013 (32- and 64-bit)
Security Agents constantly monitor clients for unusual modifications to the operating system or on installed software.
Another feature of Behavior Monitoring is to protect EXE and DLL files from being deleted or modified.
In addition, users can select to collectively protect all Intuit QuickBooks programs.
The following table describes how the different components of product_name protect your computers from threats.

In product_short_name, keywords include the following and are used to filter messages:
Short phrases (blue fish, red phone, big house, and so on)
Words or phrases connected by logical operators (apples .AND. oranges)
product_short_name can import an existing list of keywords from a text (.txt) file.
The Messaging Security Agent searches content that matches the word
The Messaging Security Agent searches for any of the keywords separated by OR
The agent searches for either apple or orange.
The Messaging Security Agent searches for all of the keywords separated by AND
The agent searches for both apple and orange.
The Messaging Security Agent excludes keywords following NOT from search.
For example, .NOT. juice. The agent searches for content that does not contain juice.
The Messaging Security Agent does not support using “?” in the wildcard command “.WILD.”.
The words Valumart, valucash, and valubucks all match.
To specify a regular expression, add a .REG. operator before that pattern (for example, .REG. a.*e).
For example, “.REG. a.*e” matches: “ace”, “ate”, and “advance”, but not “all”, “any”, nor “antivirus”
The Messaging Security Agent offers simple and powerful features to create highly specific filters.
By default, the Messaging Security Agent searches for exact matches of keywords.
You can also set the Messaging Security Agent to search for synonyms of the actual keywords.

On the Security Server computer, navigate to \PCCSRV\Admin\Utility.
product_short_name generates network traffic when the Security Server and agents communicate with each other.
The Security Server generates significant network traffic when it updates a component.
To reduce network traffic generated during component updates, the Security Server performs component duplication.
A Security Server that is updated regularly only downloads the incremental pattern.
product_short_name now supports Security Server installation on endpoints running Windows 10 Pro.
product_short_name now supports Security Server installation on endpoints running Windows Server 2016.
product_short_name can send notifications in the form of email messages to various alerts.
The Messaging Security Agent divides email traffic into two network categories: internal and external.
The agent queries the Microsoft Exchange server to learn how the internal and external addresses are defined.
You can only define one domain as the internal address for the Messaging Security Agent.
For example, you have two domain addresses for your company: @example_1.com and @example2.com.
Later, you use Microsoft Exchange System Manager to change the primary address to @example_2.com.
This means that Microsoft Exchange now recognizes addresses such as abc@example_2.com and xyz@example_2.com to be internal addresses.
A client is a computer where you plan to install a Security Agent or a Messaging Security Agent.
A single Security Server installation can manage up to 2.500 clients.
If you have more clients, Trend Micro suggests installing more than one Security Server.
